<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This book is not meant as a literary work, for I am not
and do not pretend to be a literary man. It is but a record&mdash;an
amplified log-book, as it were&mdash;of what befell me during
my solitary peregrinations in Hokkaido, and a collection of
notes and observations which I hope will prove interesting to
anthropologists and ethnologists as well as to the general
public.</p>

<p>Without any claim to infallibility I have tried to take an
open-minded and sensible view of everything I have attempted
to describe; in most cases, however, I have given facts without
passing an opinion at all, and all I have said I have tried
to express as simply and plainly as possible, so as not to give
rise to misunderstandings.</p>

<p>There are a few points which I want to make quite clear.</p>

<p>First, that I went to Hokkaido entirely on my own account
and for my own satisfaction. Next, that I accomplished the
whole journey (some 4200 miles, out of which 3800 were
ridden on horseback and on a rough pack-saddle) perfectly
alone. By alone I mean that I had with me no friends, no
servants, and no guides. My baggage consisted of next to
nothing, so far as articles for my own convenience or comfort
were concerned. I carried no provisions and no tent.</p>

<p>I am endowed with a very sensitive nature, and I pride
myself in possessing the gift of adaptability to an extreme
degree, and this may partly explain why and how I could live
so long with and like the Ainu, whose habits and customs, as
my readers will see, are somewhat different to ours.</p>

<p>When I go to a country I do my best to be like one of the
natives themselves, and, whether they are savage or not, I
endeavour to show respect for them and their ideas, and to
conform to their customs for the time being. I make up my
mind that what is good for them must be good enough for
me, and though I have occasionally had to swear at myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
for "doing in Ainuland as the Ainu does," especially as
regards the food, I was not much the worse for it in the
end. I never use force when I can win with kindness, and
in my small experience in Hokkaido and other countries I
have always found that real savages in their simplicity are
most "gentleman-like" people. With few exceptions they are
good-natured, dignified, and sensible, and the chances are that
if you are fair to them they will be fair to you. Civilised
savages and barbarians I always found untrustworthy and
dangerous.</p>

<p>The Island of Yezo, with the smaller islands near its coast,
and the Kurile group, taken together, are called "the
Hokkaido." The Hokkaido extends roughly from 41° to 51°
latitude north, and between 139° and 157° longitude east
of Greenwich.</p>

<p>My view of the origin of the word Ainu is this: <i>Ainu</i> is
but a corruption or abbreviation of <i>Ai-num</i>, "they with hair,"
or "hairy men," or else of <i>Hain-num</i>, "come with hair," or
"descended hairy." Considering that the Ainu pride themselves
above all things on their hairiness, it does not seem
improbable to me that this may be the correct origin of the
word, and that they called themselves after the distinguishing
characteristic of their race.</p>

<p>The word Ainu is a generic term, and is used both in the
singular and plural; but when specifying, the words <i>Kuru</i>
(people, men), <i>utaragesh</i> (woman), etc., are generally added to
it: viz., <i>Ainu kuru</i>, Ainu people, Ainu men; <i>Ainu utaragesh</i>,
an Ainu woman; <i>Ainu utaragesh utara</i>, several Ainu women.</p>

<p>The Ainu population of Yezo is roughly reckoned by the
Japanese at about 15,000 or 17,000 souls, but at least half
this number are half-castes, and in my opinion (and I have
visited nearly every Ainu village in Yezo) the number of
thoroughbred Ainu does not exceed 8000 souls.</p>

<p>The illustrations in this book are my own, and are the
reproductions from sketches which I took on the spot. They
may not show much artistic merit, but they seem to me to be
characteristic of the country and the people, and I hope that
my readers will be impressed with them in the same way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="small">From Hakodate to Mororran&mdash;Volcano Bay&mdash;The first Ainu&mdash;A strange
Institution among them.</span></h2>


<p>I have often asked myself <i>why</i> I went to Yezo; and, when
there, what possessed me to undertake the laborious task of
going round the island, up its largest rivers, travelling through
jungles and round lakes, climbing its highest peaks, and then
proceeding to the Kuriles. There are certain things in one's
life that cannot be accounted for, and the journey which I am
going to relate is one of them.</p>

<p>Pleasure and rest were the two principal objects which had
primarily induced me to steer northwards; but it was my fate
not to get either the one or the other.</p>

<p>I was on the Japanese ship the <i>Satsuma Maru</i>. Rapidly
nearing the Hakodate Head, which we soon passed, we entered
the well-protected bay and the town of Hakodate at the
foot of the Peak came into view. It looked extremely pretty,
with its paper-walled houses and its tiled roofs, set against
the background of brown rock with its fringe of green at
the foot. As we cast anchor, hundreds of coolies, carrying
on their backs loads of dried fish and seaweed, were running
along the <i>bund</i> or wharf. A few <i>musemes</i> (girls), in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
pretty <i>kimonos</i> (gowns) and with oil-paper umbrellas, were
toddling along on their wooden clogs, and a crowd of loafers
stood gazing at the ship as she came to anchor. The Peak,
more than 1000 feet high, was towering on our south side,
forming a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a sandy
isthmus, and the large bay swept round us, forming nearly a
circle. The place has a striking resemblance to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>I landed, and put up at a tea-house, where I was in hopes
of learning something regarding the island from the Japanese
settlers, but no one knew anything. The reports that there
were no roads extending beyond a few miles; that there was
but very poor and scarce accommodation along the coast;
that the Ainu, who lived further north, were dirty people; and
that the country was full of bears, were certainly not encouraging
to an intending traveller.</p>

<p>I must confess that my first day in Yezo was a dull one;
but the second day I had the pleasure of meeting a Mr. H., a
resident, who kindly offered me his hospitality, and the next
two were pleasantly spent at his house. In conversation
with a friend of his, I heard the remark that no man alone
could possibly complete the circuit of the island of Yezo,
owing to the difficulties of travel; and my readers can imagine
the astonishment of my interlocutors when I meekly said, that
if no one had ever done it, I was going to do it; and, indeed,
that I intended to set out alone the next morning.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said one, "you are too young and too
delicate."</p>

<p>"Absurd!" said my kind host, "it would take a very strong
man to do it&mdash;a man who could stand any amount of hardships
and roughing." At the same time he gave me a pitiful
look, which undoubtedly meant, "You are a mere bag of skin
and bones."</p>

<p>However, the bag of skin and bones kept his word, notwithstanding
the poor opinion that his new friends had
formed of him.</p>

<p>The preparations for my journey were simple. In two
large Japanese baskets I packed three hundred small wooden
panels for oil-painting, a large supply of oil colours and
brushes, a dozen small sketch-books, my diary, three pairs of
boots, three shirts, an equal number of pairs of woollen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
stockings, a revolver, and a hundred cartridges. The remainder
of my luggage was left in charge of Mr. H. till my
return. I did not burden myself with either provisions or
a tent.</p>

<p>I rose early the following morning and bade good-bye to
my kind host. "Good-bye," said he, "I expect we shall see
you back to-night to dinner." The word "dinner" was the
last English word I heard from the mouth of an Englishman,
and it was five long months before I heard another.</p>

<p>The first thirty miles of my journey were ridden in a
<i>basha</i>, a covered cart built on four wheels that ought to have
been round, but were not. There were no springs for the
comfort of the traveller, and no cushions on the seats. The
conveyance was public, and was drawn by two sturdy ponies.
The driver, a Japanese, carried a brass trumpet, on which he
continually played.</p>

<p>I might have begun my story by the usual "One fine day,"
if, unfortunately, the day on which I started the rain had not
poured in torrents. A Japanese policeman and a girl were my
only fellow-passengers. Travelling at full gallop, on a rough
road, in a trap with unsymmetrical wheels and with no springs,
during a heavy storm, is scarcely what one would call a
pleasant mode of progression; but after some hours of "being
knocked about," we went zig-zag fashion, first up a steep hill,
then down on the other side, giving the horses a rest at a
roadside tea-house by the famous lakes of Zenzai. The larger
of these two lakes&mdash;the Ko-numa&mdash;is extremely picturesque,
with its numerous little islands wooded with deciduous trees.
In shape it is very irregular, and many points, which project
into the lake, add to the loveliness of the scene, while the
high ridge over which I had come, on the one side, and the
rugged volcano of Komagatake on the other, form a beautiful
background to the limpid sheet of water. The outlet of this
lake empties itself into Volcano Bay, S.E. of the Komagatake
Volcano. The other lake, though smaller, is quite as striking,
and possesses the same characteristics of its larger brother.
It goes by the name of Ono-numa. A peculiarity of these
lakes is that they abound in a smallish fish&mdash;the <i>funa</i>&mdash;which
is greatly appreciated by the Japanese.</p>

<p>I sat down in the tea-house on the soft mats, and my <i>bento</i>&mdash;Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
lunch&mdash;was served to me on a tiny table. There
was water soup; there was sea-weed; there was a bowl of
rice, and raw fish. The fish&mdash;a small <i>funa</i>&mdash;was in a diminutive
dish and its back was covered by a leaf; the head projected
over the side of the plate. On the leaf were placed
several neatly-cut pieces of the raw flesh, which had apparently
been removed from the back of the underlying animal. As I
had been long accustomed to Japanese food of this kind I ate
to my heart's content, when, to my great horror, the <i>funa</i>,
which had been staring at me with its round eyes, relieved of
the weight that had passed from its back into my digestive
organs, leaped up, leaf and all, from the dish and fell on the
mat. All the vital parts had carefully been left in the fish, and
the wretched creature was still alive!</p>

<p>"Horrible!" I cried, violently pushing away the table and
walking out disgusted, to the great surprise of the people
present, who expected me to revel in the deliciousness of
the dish.</p>

<p>For days and days after I could see in my mind the staring
eyes of the <i>funa</i>, watching each movement of my chopsticks,
and its own back being eaten piecemeal! Wherever I went
this big eye stood before me, and increased or diminished in
size according to my being more or less lonely, more or less
hungry. I had often eaten raw fish before, but never had I
eaten live fish!</p>

<p>The journey in the <i>basha</i> was resumed that afternoon, and,
more dead than alive, I alighted in the evening at Mori, a
small Japanese village at the foot of the Komagatake
Volcano. The peak of this mountain is 4000 feet above the
level of the sea, but its basin-like crater is at a somewhat
lower altitude. Up to a certain height it is thickly wooded
with deciduous trees and firs, thence its slopes are bare of
vegetation, rugged in form, and very rich in colour. It makes
part of a volcanic mass which extends from the Esan Volcano,
further south, to the limit of the Shiribeshi province, crossing
straight through the province of Oshima as far as the Yurapdake
Mountain. Komagatake is one of the most majestic and
picturesque mountains I have ever seen, as it possesses lovely
lines on nearly every side. Its isolation and sudden sharp
elevation, rising as it does directly from the sea, gives, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
a grand appearance to its weird and sterile slopes, which are
covered with warmly-tinted cinders, pumice, and lava.</p>

<p>I went over to Mororran, across Volcano Bay, and the
following morning I risked my life on a small craft, which
took me over to Mombets. From this place I rode on to
Uso and Aputa, two Ainu villages at a short distance from
each other.</p>

<p>Coming from Japan the first thing that strikes a traveller in
the Ainu country is the odour of dried fish, which one can
smell everywhere; the next is the great number of crows&mdash;the
scavengers of the country; lastly, the volcanic nature of
the island. On visiting an Ainu village what impressed me
most were the miserable and filthy huts, compared with the
neat and clean Japanese houses; the poverty and almost appalling
dirt of the people and their gentle, submissive nature.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell at length on these Volcano Bay Ainu, as
this part of the country is comparatively civilised, and has
been travelled over by many people previous to my going
there. Besides, most of them have intermarried with Japanese,
and have consequently adopted many Japanese customs and
manners.</p>

<p>The Ainu of the coast build their huts generally on a single
line, near the shore, and each family has its "dug out" canoe
drawn up on the beach, ready to hand when wanted. The
huts are small and miserable-looking, and they have no
furniture or bedding to speak of. The roof and walls are
thatched with <i>arundinaria</i>, but so imperfectly that wind and
rain find easy access through their reedy covering. Curiosity
is the only good quality which I ever possessed, and in obedience
to it I poked my nose into several of the huts along
the beach. This was a mistake on my part, for in the Ainu
country the nose is the last thing one ought to poke in anywhere.
I was more than astonished to see how human beings
could live in such filth! The natives kindly asked me to enter,
and I of course did so, stooping low through the small door and
raising the mat which protects the aperture. When I was in
I could smell a great deal more than I could see, for the east
window&mdash;the size of a small handkerchief, and the only one in
the hut&mdash;did not give light enough to illuminate the premises.
However, I soon got accustomed to the dimness, and then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
could make out my surroundings clearly enough. There was
an old man, perfectly naked, with a fine head, long white
hair and beard, sitting on the ground among a mass of seaweeds,
which he was disentangling and packing. Two young
women and two young men, with bright, intelligent eyes and
high cheek-bones, were helping him in his work. In their
quiet, gentle way they all brought their hands forward, each
rubbed the palms together, and, lifting the arms, slowly
stroked their hair, and the men their beard with the backs of
their hands, while the women rubbed the first finger under
the nose from the left to the right.
This is their salutation, and it
is most graceful. They seemed
pleased to see me, and asked me
to sit down. As there were neither
chairs nor sofas, stools nor cushions,
I squatted on the ground.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="images/illus-006.jpg" width="146" height="122" alt="AINU WOMAN SALUTING" title="" />
<span class="caption">AINU WOMAN SALUTING.</span></div>

<p>Most Ainu of Volcano Bay
understand Japanese, and they also
speak it, interpolating Ainu words
when necessary, so I began a conversation.
My presence did not seem to disturb them or
arouse their curiosity, and, beyond gazing at the mother-of-pearl
buttons on my white coat, they did not appear to be
struck by me. Evidently the buttons were much more
interesting to them than the person who wore them. Now
and then they uttered a few words, but whenever one spoke
some of the company seemed to be angry, as at an impertinence
or a breach of etiquette. Men and women wore large ear-rings
or pieces of red or black cloth, which added a great deal to
their picturesqueness; but the women were disfigured by a long
moustache tattooed across the face from ear to ear. Rough
drawings adorn the arms and hands of the women, and some
of the younger females would undoubtedly be fine-looking if
not disfigured by the tattoos, for they carry themselves well
when walking, and possess comely features. Judging from
appearances, I should think them very passionate.</p>

<p>Coming out of the hut I saw a scene which I shall never
forget. Two naked boys, covered with horrible skin eruptions,
had got hold of a large fish-bone, out of which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
were endeavouring to make a meal. Round them were
gathered about thirty dogs, wild with hunger, barking furiously
at the frightened children, and attacking and fighting them
for that miserable repast.</p>

<p>I walked along the beach, and endeavoured to make
friends with some of the Ainu who were less shy than the
others. One little girl was especially picturesque. She was
only about ten, and her large eyes, tanned complexion, white
teeth, the tiny bluish-black tattoo on her upper lip, her
uncombed long black hair flying around her, and her red
cloth ear-rings, made her indeed one of the quaintest studies
of colour that I have seen in my life. I got her to sit for
me; and while I was painting her, an old man, the chief of
the village, dressed up in a gaudy costume, with a crown of
willow shavings on his head, came to me and made his
"salaams." He bore the name of Angotsuro, and before all
his salaams were over he found himself "caught in the action"
in my sketch-book. Many of the villagers had collected
round, and one of them, a half-caste, expressed the wish that
I should paint the chief in colours, like the picture of the girl.
I asked for nothing better, and started an oil-sketch of him.
The excitement of the natives who were witnessing the operation
grew greater and greater as each new ornament in the
chief's dress was put in the picture. Some seemed to approve
of it, others were grumpy, and apparently objected to the
picture being taken at all. The <i>séance</i> was indeed a stormy
one; and though the chief had his regal crown knocked off his
head two or three times by the anti-artistic party, he sat well
for his likeness, especially as I promised him in Japanese, that
when the picture was completed he should be given a few
coins and two buttons off my coat.</p>

<p>It was while portraying him that I noticed what extraordinary
effects colours produce on those whose eyes are
unaccustomed to them. A man in the crowd would get
excited, and open his eyes wide and show his teeth every
time I happened to touch with my brush the cobalt blue on
my palette. Other colours had not the same effect on him.
His eyes were continually fixed on the blue, anxiously waiting
for the brush to dip in it, and this would then send him into
fits of merriment. I squeezed some blue paint from a tube on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to the palm of his hand, and he nearly went off his head with
delight. He sprang and jumped and yelled, and then ran
some way off, where he squatted on the sand, still in admiration
of the blue dab on his hand, still grinning at intervals
with irrepressible enjoyment. Where the point of the joke
was no one but himself ever knew.</p>

<p>When the picture was finished I had no little trouble to
keep the many fingers of my audience off the wet painting.
Moreover, some person endowed with kindly feelings threw
a handful of sand in my face, which nearly blinded me for
the moment and partly ruined the two pictures I had painted.
The money and the buttons were duly paid to Angotsuro
and I moved on.</p>

<p>That same evening I went out for a walk. It was a very
dark night, and I love dark nights. When for some years
you have done nothing but see strange things and new places
there is indeed a great fascination in going about in complete
darkness; it rests both your eyes and your brain. I
walked for some time along the beach, stumbling against the
canoes drawn on shore and against anything that was in my
way. Hut after hut was passed, but everything was silent;
there was not a sound to be heard, not a light to be seen.
The Ainu are early people; they retire with the sun. I
walked on yet farther and farther afield, till through the
thatched wall of one of the huts I discerned a faint light.
I stood and listened. The sad voice of a man was singing
a weird, weird song, the weirdest song I have ever heard.
Then came a pause, and another voice, even more plaintive
than the first, continued the same air.</p>

<p>What with the strange melody in the hut, the soothing
noise of the waves gently breaking on the shingle, and the
distant howling of dogs or wolves, the mystic effect was such
that I could not resist the temptation, and I crept into the
hut. A fire was burning in the centre, but it had almost gone
out, leaving a lot of smoke. Three old men were sitting on
the ground. They decidedly looked as if they did not expect
me, but, after their first astonishment was over, they asked me
to squat down in a corner, and there I was left to amuse
myself, while they resumed their singing and drinking. Of the
latter they seemed to have had enough already; but, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
same, several wooden bowls, about five inches in diameter
and two deep, were passed round and emptied in no time.
The more they drank, the wilder and more melancholy the
song became. Only one at a time sang, and he would begin
in a very low tone of voice and go up in a <i>crescendo</i>, gradually
getting awfully excited; then all at once he would stop, as if
the effort had been too great for him. His head drooped, and
he seemed to sleep. Then, suddenly waking up, coming back
to his full senses in a startling manner, he drained one of the
bowls, which meantime had been refilled, and resumed the song.
The three men were facing each other, and so absorbed were
they in their music that, though I was not more than four feet
away from them, they seemed to have forgotten me altogether.</p>

<p>I was so impressed with the strangeness of the song that I
pulled out my pencil and paper to write down the air. As there
was no light but the flicker of the fire, I turned the white leaf
of my sketch-book toward it to see what I was writing. This
caught the eye of one of the men. He woke up, startled from
his musical dream, jumped to his feet, and made a dash for
me, yelling some words which I did not understand, and holding
over my head something that I could not distinguish at
the moment owing to the dimness of the light. Standing thus
he paused, evidently waiting for an answer to something he
had said. It came from one of the other fellows, who pushed
him so violently as to send him sprawling on the floor, while,
what he held in his hand&mdash;a big, heavy, pointed knife&mdash;fell
and stuck deep in the ground about an inch from my toes.
A dispute arose among themselves, but among the Ainu everything
ends up in a drink. The large wooden bowls were again
refilled; grand bows were made to me, and they all stroked their
hair and beard several times&mdash;a sign of great respect. I was
then handed one of the bowls and made to swallow the contents.
But, heavens! never have I felt any liquid work its way down
so far. Had I swallowed fire it could not have been as bad;
and, indeed, it was neither more nor less than liquid fire.</p>

<p>As the night was wearing fast, and the old fellows had got
on well with their drink, the sing-song became rather too
languid and monotonous; and I crept out of the hut as
quietly as I had entered it, not without first giving the
inmates something for their trouble. I had some difficulty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
finding my way back to my less musical quarters; and passing
too close to some of the other huts, the dogs&mdash;which infest all
Ainu villages&mdash;barked furiously and roused the whole place.</p>

<p>I learned afterwards that it is an Ainu fashion to try a
man's courage. This is done in the way in which my musical
friends tried mine, namely, by making a sudden rush with a
knife as if death and destruction were imminent, which to
a perfect stranger, unconscious of the strain of "bluff" in the
action, is not very reassuring. If the person to be tested is
aware of this fashion he has to submit to an unlimited number
of whacks, administered to him on his bare back, with a heavy
war-club. These tests of a man's courage and endurance are
called the <i>Ukorra</i>.</p>

<p>In the first instance it is done, in a certain sense, good-naturedly,
and not meaning to hurt one. Should, however,
the person apparently so dangerously threatened show fright or
signs of cowardice, he loses the respect of the Ainu, unless he has
the happy thought of giving them a sufficient quantity of some
intoxicating liquor to make them all drunk&mdash;which is a sure
means of turning the most inimical Ainu you may meet into
your fast friend, even if you have had a deadly feud with him.</p>

<p>The second way&mdash;with the war-club&mdash;of course is a painful
process, and the Ainu have recourse to it when it is necessary
to determine the relative amount of courage possessed by
certain members of a community. The one that can stand the
greater number of blows is naturally entitled to the respect
and admiration of his neighbours, and he is elected leader in
bear-hunts or similar expeditions. At the election of a new
chief&mdash;when the chief's line of descendants dies out&mdash;this
process, I was told, is often practised; for bravery is the first
quality which an Ainu chief must possess.</p>

<p>At Aputa, through some of the half-castes, I was able to
pick up a great number of Ainu words, which were most
useful to me afterwards; and from that, gradually increasing
my stock of words, I soon knew enough to understand a little
and also to make myself understood.</p>

<p>One day I went along the coast to the next village of
Repun, and then retraced my steps to Aputa, as there was
nothing of interest at the former place.</p>

<p>An excursion which I enjoyed more was to the Toya Lake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
with its three pretty islands in the centre and the magnificent
Uso Volcano on its southern shores. The walk there and
back was hardly fifteen miles, over a mountain track and
through forests of pine-trees and oaks. The lake is about
250 feet above the level of the sea, and is about five miles in
diameter. Its shores are surrounded with thickly-wooded
hills, which have grassy terraces at a certain altitude, extending
especially towards the north-western shores of the lake.
The barren Uso Volcano, with its sterile slopes, is a great
contrast to the beautiful green of the comparatively luxuriant
vegetation of the lower altitudes. The lake finds an outlet
into the Osaru River by means of a high waterfall.</p>

<p>The following day I rode back to Mombets, and the next on to
Shin-Mororran (the <i>new</i> Mororran, distinguished by this affix
from Kiu-Mororran, the <i>old</i> settlement on the northern shore).</p>

<p>Mororran has a well-protected harbour, and it would be the
best future port in Hokkaido if the anchorage were of a larger
capacity. In more speculative hands than the Japanese this
port would be a great rival to Hakodate. It consists of a
thickly-wooded peninsula, which forms a well-sheltered bay, at
the entrance of which the picturesque island of Daikuku stands
high above the sea-level. In the harbour itself, smaller islets
and huge rocks contribute to its beauty.</p>

<p>The village of Mororran is a mere streak of fourth-rate tea-houses
along the road by the side of the cliffs. Apart from
the natural loveliness of the harbour, it has, indeed, no claims to
consideration at present. In former days it was called by the
Ainu, Tokri-moi, "the home of the seals," for these valuable
amphibious animals were said to be then plentiful in the bay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="small">From Mororran to the Saru River.</span></h2>


<p>Thirteen more miles in a <i>basha</i>&mdash;for I was still in civilised
regions&mdash;took me to Horobets&mdash;a village half Ainu and half
Japanese.</p>

<p>The Ainu often name their villages after rivers, and this
word Horobets, which in English means "large river," is an
instance of this custom. In Southern Japan, previous to my
visiting Yezo, I was told that nearly all the Ainu of Horobets
had become "good Christians." If such were the case, which
I do not wish my readers to doubt, the small experience which
I had here, led me to believe that "good Christians" often
make "very bad heathens."</p>

<p>I left all my baggage in a tea-house at the entrance of the
village, and, taking my paint-box with me, I went for a walk
along the beach. I saw a crowd of Ainu in the distance,
and I hurried up to them. They were busy skinning a large
Ushi-sakana (cow-fish), cutting it into pieces with their long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
knives. They did not pay much attention to me, and this disregard
of what would be to others a cause of curiosity and interruption
I afterwards found to be a characteristic of the
Ainu. They are seldom distracted from any particular idea
that occupies their mind at a certain moment. In fact, they
are so little accustomed to reflect at all, that it seems almost
impossible for them to think of two things at the same time.
Of all the existing races of mankind they may be said to be
the most purely one-idea'd.</p>

<p>Stark naked, with their long hair streaming in the wind, they
formed a picturesque group. What a chance for a sketch! I
sat down on the sand, opened my paint-box, and dashed off
a picture, when a young lad, who had taken his share of the
fish, came over to see what I was doing. "What is it?" he
asked me in broken Japanese, to which question I answered
that I was painting the group of them. The news seemed to
give him a shock. He rejoined the others, excitedly muttered
some words, and apparently told them that I had painted the
whole group, fish and all. Had anyone among them been
struck by lightning, they could certainly not have looked more
dismayed. I never knew until then that painting could have
such an overpowering effect on people, except, perhaps, when
one has sat to an amateur artist for one's own likeness, the result
of which is often one of dumb and blank amazement.
Anger and disgust naturally followed. The fish was thrown
aside, but not the knives, armed with which they all rushed at
my back. The sudden change of ideas had evidently made
them exceedingly angry. The grumbling became very loud,
and louder still when they saw me complacently giving the
finishing touches to the fish, which was now left alone, and not
as before shifted about every second. They grew wilder and
wilder, until one of the crowd shouted in my ears some words
which sounded remarkably like swearing. Nevertheless it
takes more than that to stop me from sketching; but ...
"By Jove!" I exclaimed, when, all of a sudden, a rush was
made on me. My paint-box, picture, palette and brushes
were snatched out of my hands and smashed or flung away,
and I found myself stretched on the sand, my late involuntary
sitters holding me down fast by the legs and arms. A big
knife was kept well over my head, so that I should not attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to move, while the painting, on a heavy wooden panel, was
being mercilessly destroyed by others. "If these are Christians,
well I am ..." were, I must confess, the first words that
rose to my lips.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, difficult to describe how and what one feels
when, to all appearance, one is going to be murdered&mdash;for
painting a fish! My first thought, of course, went to my
parents. My next was, what a nuisance it was to be murdered
with the sun shining in my eyes, so that I could not even see
who would give me the "finishing touch." All the events of
my life, the bad ones first, flashed across my mind in those few
seconds, and then I almost began to feel as if I had made my
first steps into the other world, and I could see angels and
devils disputing for my company&mdash;the devils, of course, having
by far the largest claims. The bitterness of death had in some
sense passed, when, to my great astonishment, and with a few,
but very sound, kicks I was made to understand that I could
get up and go.</p>

<p>The sensation of being brought back to life, when one has
made up one's mind to be dead, notwithstanding the abrupt
manner in which it was produced, was indeed a pleasant one.
I did get up, and pretty quick, I can tell you; but only to
see my poor wooden paint-box floating half-smashed in the
sea, my brushes stuck here and there in the sand, and the
sketch utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>My assailants were about fifteen or twenty, and I was alone.
Stupidly enough, and relying on the Christianity of the
people, I had not burdened myself with the extra weight of
my revolver; I had left it with my heavy luggage in the
small Japanese tea-house where I had put up, nearly a mile
away. The Japanese police-station was at Washibets, another
village some miles off. Nothing was left for me but to pick
up the few unbroken brushes which were within easy reach
and retire; but I was neither frightened nor conquered, and I
swore to myself that I would have my revenge. I hurried
to the tea-house, took my revolver, and filled my pocket
with cartridges, then I ran back to the spot where I had
sketched and been assaulted. There they all were as I had
left them, one of them mimicking me with the broken palette,
which he had fished out of the sea. I had kept well behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
some thick brushwood, so that they should not see me, and
for some time watched them unobserved. The imitation was
perfect. The impromptu Raphael's hair was long enough to
give him the look of an artist, and he was sufficiently brave to
carry on his imitation sketching under a shower of missiles
and sand thrown at him by his friends and companions. As
he turned his head I recognised in my brother-artist the man
who had been holding the knife over my head about an hour
before, and also the very person who had given me the
soundest kick. Just like a brother-artist! If my sketching
had not lasted long, his parody was even shorter. I sprang
out from the brushwood screen and caught him by the throat,
pointing my revolver at his head, and telling him in Japanese
to follow me to the police-station. Another man, attacking
me from behind, stabbed me in my left arm, but not very
severely, as I saw him just in time to avoid his blow. The
sight of my revolver had a salutary effect on my hairy friends,
and they were done out of their fun when, keeping them at
bay, I told them that if they did not follow me they would all
be dead men before they knew where they were. They had
seen guns of the Japanese, and they knew the effects of them,
so the saucy gentlemen stroked their hair and beard and made
signs of submission and obedience. However, I was not to be
easily appeased, as it was necessary to give them a lesson to
prevent the same thing happening to future travellers; so I
made them march in front of me, not caring to have them at
my back, and thus took them all to the Japanese police-station,
where they were duly arrested. The Japanese are
very severe with recalcitrant Ainu, and my assailants would
have been unmercifully dealt with had it not been for their
wives and children, who came to me begging me to forgive
their husbands and fathers for what they had done. I
willingly did so, on condition that they should all come and
prostrate themselves at my feet, imploring pardon and forgiveness
and offering submission, as well as confessing their
sorrow. This penitential function was reluctantly fixed by the
Japanese policeman&mdash;the only one in the place&mdash;at a late
hour in the afternoon. During the interval, as I fortunately
had a large supply of painting materials, I managed to repaint
from memory the scene represented in the sketch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
destroyed. The evening came, and the little Japanese policeman
brought the resigned and humbled Ainu to the inn.
Their wives and relatives followed, and they all looked
supremely mournful and sad. I sat, Japanese fashion, on the
small verandah on the ground-floor, and the policeman placed
the Ainu on a line in front of me, and then came to sit by my
side. He then addressed them, partly in the Ainu language,
partly in Japanese, and bestowed on them names which went
well to the point. He scolded them harshly, and asked them
why they had assaulted me.</p>

<p>One of them, as grave as a judge, with his eyes cast down,
and in a half-broken voice, came forward and said, that if once
you have your likeness taken you have to give up your life
to it, and it brings illness to yourself, to your children, your
parents, and your neighbours. Not only that, but as I had
<i>taken</i> many people together, famine was sure to fall on the
country. "Then," he added&mdash;and he seemed positive of what
he was talking about&mdash;"then there was a fish the stranger
<i>made</i>"&mdash;the Ainu have no word for painting&mdash;"and had we
not destroyed his <i>makings</i> all the fish would have disappeared
from the sea, and all the Ainu would have died of starvation"&mdash;which
was a terrible contingency, as the Ainu live mainly
by fishing. "We have not hurt the stranger," continued this
hairy representative of Master Eustache de St. Pierre, "and
now that all the Ainu and the fish he made are destroyed
we are safe."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said I, when, by the aid of the policeman,
I understood the meaning of this long harangue, and I
produced the large sketch of the scene which I had repainted
from memory. This certainly beat them. They could hardly
believe their own eyes, and looked at each other as if some
great calamity were approaching. I have no doubt that they
considered me an evil spirit, and, as such, too powerful to be
contended with. Discretion was their best part of valour, as
they proved. One by one they approached the verandah, sat
cross-legged in front of me, rubbed their hands together,
stroked their hair and beard three times, and three times each
put his head down to my feet, begging my pardon. The
Ainu women and children who had assembled in the back
yard, where the function took place, were crying and moaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
piteously. The most trying part for me was, of course, to
keep serious during this long tragi-comic performance, and I
was indeed glad when it was all over; when my supremacy
was acknowledged, and my immunity from further insult
secured; when submission had been made, and such whips and
stings of outrageous fortune as might come from the painting
of a fish had been humbly accepted.</p>

<p>The Ainu are gentle and mild by nature, but, like all
ignorant people, they are extremely superstitious, and superstition
is a powerful excitant. Nevertheless, they are good
people in their own way, and it must not be inferred from this
small experience of mine that they are bullies, for they are
not. The superstition regarding the reproduction of images
is common all through the East, with the exception of the
Japanese, and in many parts of Europe itself strange ideas are
connected with portrait-painting. In Spain or Italy many a
girl of the lower classes would think herself dishonoured if
she happened to be sketched unawares, or if her picture were
shown without the consent of her parents, brothers, relatives,
and the parish priest.</p>

<p>However, these Horobets Ainu are said, since civilisation
has set in in that part of Yezo, of late years to have become
untrustworthy and violent. They are more given to drunkenness
than their neighbours, as they can procure from the
Japanese stronger beverages than their own. <i>Sake</i> (Japanese
wine) of inferior quality is sold and exchanged in large
quantities, and has the same fatal effects on them as rum&mdash;our
fire-water&mdash;had on the American Indians.</p>

<p>I was not sorry to leave a village which had displayed so
little appreciation of my art. I took two ponies and two
pack-saddles, to one of which was lashed my baggage, while I
sat on the other. Riding is a delightful pastime when you
have a good horse and a good saddle; but not when you have
to look after two vicious animals, and are yourself perched on
a rough wooden pack-saddle. Moreover, Ainu pack-saddles
are perhaps the most uncomfortable of their kind. The
illustration shows one of them. It is made with a rough, solid
wooden frame, of which the front and back parts are semicircular.
One large hole is perforated in each of these to
allow ropes to be passed through. Under this frame are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
mat cushions or pads, which are somehow supposed to fit the
pony's back; and by means of three ropes, one of which is
passed under the pony's body and fastened on each side of
the saddle, while the others hang loose across its chest and
under its tail respectively, the pack-saddle is made to
remain in position either going uphill, downhill, or on level
ground. Stirrups, of course, there are none; and mounting
involves some difficulties at first. One has to face one's pony
and place the left foot on the breast-piece, lift oneself up and
swing right round, describing three-quarters of a circle before
attaining one's seat in the saddle. If distances are miscalculated
in this gymnastic feat, it is a common occurrence to find
oneself seated on the pony's neck, or else landed heavily on
either of the two hard wooden arches of the saddle, instead of
gracefully falling between them. Keeping your equilibrium
when you are on is also a trying exercise to anybody not born
and bred a circus rider, and balancing your baggage perfectly
on each side of the saddle is somewhat more difficult than
it sounds.</p>

<p>Nine miles from Horobets one comes across the Nobori-bets<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
hot-springs. There was, formerly, a <i>geiser</i> here, but it
is seldom active now. These hot-springs are situated two-and-a-half
miles from the sea-coast, and a miserable building,
which is a mere shanty, is built in the vicinity of them,
where people who wish to be cured of different complaints
put up and take the waters.</p>

<p>I rode on to the Noboribets village, consisting of a few houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
only; and, though I reached it late in the evening, I had to ride
fourteen miles further to Shiraoi, "a place of horse-flies."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>At sunrise I was up again and on my way to Tomakomai,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
the largest Japanese fishing village between Mororran and
Cape Erimo.</p>

<img src="images/illus-019.jpg" width="244" height="342" alt="NOBORIBETS VOLCANO" />
<span class="caption">NOBORIBETS VOLCANO.</span></div>

<p>Sardine fishing is the principal and, indeed, the only industry
of the place. It is carried on in a practical way.
When the long nets are ready, and one end of them is
fastened to the shore, they launch the boat, which is rowed
rapidly by twenty or thirty strong men, while the net is
dropped as the boat goes along. Having thus described a
semicircle, the boat is beached. All on board jump out, and
the net is pulled on shore amid the shrieks and yells of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
excited fishermen. Myriads of sardines are caught each time
the net is hauled in; and it is a fantastic scene to see the
naked crowd which, in clearing the nets from the beheaded
fish, get covered with silver scales, which stick to their arms,
legs, and body, and give them a strange appearance.</p>

<p><i>Look-out</i> towers are built on four high posts, where a
watchman is posted to signal the arrival and approach of the
shoals. The sea is so dense with them that it changes its
colour, and these moving banks of sardines are distinguishable
four or five miles from the coast. This method is the same
as that adopted in Cornwall when the pilchards are expected,
and the same discoloration of the sea takes place.</p>

<p>From Tomakomai a road branches to the north leading
to Sappro, the capital of Hokkaido, and it is the last place on
the southern coast which is visited by that rare specimen of
the globe-trotter who ventures to Yezo. He hastily makes
his way from here to Sappro and Otaru on the northern coast,
and waits for a ship to be conveyed back to Hakodate. He
then, of course, tells his friends that he has been round and
about and through Yezo, while in fact he has seen absolutely
nothing of Yezo or its inhabitants. About half-a-dozen
Europeans, however, have been further on&mdash;as far as the Saru
River; and each one has written a book on the Ainu, for the
most part copying what the previous author had written.</p>

<p>As far as Tomakomai there is a road&mdash;a sure sign of
civilisation&mdash;but nothing but a horse-track is to be found all
along the southern coast after this place has been passed.</p>

<p>Changing my ponies at Yuhuts,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> nine miles east, and again
at Mukawa and Saru-buto, I was able to reach Saru Mombets
that same night. Many Ainu and Japanese fishermen's huts
are scattered between Horohuts<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and Yuhuts, on the sandy
track along the sea.</p>

<p>The traveller then leaves the sea on the right, and by a
very uneven track, and after fording several rivers of little
importance comes to Mukawa, a dirty little village fourteen
miles from Yuhuts. My lunch that day consisted of a large
piece of raw salmon, which was easily digested in riding nine
more miles to Saru-buto. Sharu in Ainu, corrupted into Saru,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
means a grassy plain; and <i>buto</i> is a Japanese corruption of
the Ainu word <i>huts</i>, the mouth of a river. My ponies must
have known of this "grassy plain," for they went remarkably
well, and I reached the latter village some time before dark, so
that I was able to push on to Saru Mombets, a larger village
nearly four miles further. Saru Mombets translated means
"a tranquil river in a grassy plain," a name thoroughly
appropriate to the locality.</p>

<p>There is nothing to interest the traveller along the coast,
unless he be a geologist. Almost the whole of the western
part of the Iburi district is of volcanic formation. The eastern
part is abundant in sandstones, breccias, and shales. In the
neighbourhood of Yuhuts, and all along the coast as far west
as Horobets, pumice forms the surface soil, showing that in
former days frequent eruptions must have taken place. Vegetable
mould alternates with pumice. Sand, clay, tufa, with
beds of peat and gravel, are the components of the soil
which is found filling up the declivities of mountains, covering
low-lands and sea-beaches in this part of the island. Specimens
of the palæozoic group are found in the pebbles of the
Mukawa River and valley, like amphibolite, limestone, phyllite,
sandstone, and clay-slate, besides variegated quartzite
of greenish and red layers. Primary rocks are common all
through Iburi and Hidaka.</p>

<p>The terraces surrounding the Saru valley are mostly wooded
with oak, and the swampy region between the Mukawa and
Sarubuto has many patches of green grass, and a thick
growth of high swamp reeds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="small">Up the Saru River&mdash;Piratori and its chief.</span></h2>


<p>A large number of Ainu have taken up their abode on the
banks of the River Saru, or Sharu, as it is called by them, and
Piratori, nearly fifteen miles from the coast, is the largest village
of the whole series.</p>

<p>The scenery from the coast to this village is not grand, but
pretty, through a thickly-wooded country and along grassy
plains. The Ainu give to the plain itself the name of Sharu-Ru,
which corresponds in English to a "track in a grassy
plain." Along this water-way, or not far from it, one meets
with numerous small Ainu villages and scattered huts until
Piratori is reached.</p>

<p>Piratori is a string or succession of many villages on undulating
ground, the last of them being situated on a high
cliff overlooking the river. In the Ainu language <i>Pira</i> means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
"a cliff," and <i>Tori</i> "a residence." As in all Ainu villages, the
huts are in one line, some few yards one from the other. Each
has a separate structure&mdash;a small storehouse built on piles&mdash;generally
at the west end of the hut.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Piratori, I was welcomed by Benry, the
<i>Ottena</i> (chief) of the village, who invited me to his hut and
<i>salaamed</i> me in the most solemn manner, not forgetting to
mention incidentally that "his throat was very dry," and that
<i>sake</i> (Japanese wine) could be obtained from a Japanese who
lives opposite to his hut.</p>

<p>"He is a bad man," said Benry confidentially; "but he
sells very good <i>sake</i>."</p>

<p>The <i>sake</i> was procured, and Benry, beaming with joy, poured
it with his shaky, drunken hands into a large bowl. He then
produced a wooden stick, shaped like a paper-knife, about five
inches in length, and waved it in the air five or six times with
his right hand, dipping the point of it each time into the fluid.
"<i>Nishpa</i>"&mdash;sir, master&mdash;said he. Then, leaning forwards and
lifting up his heavy moustache with the small stick, he
swallowed the contents of the bowl at a draught. The same
performance took place each time that some fresh <i>sake</i> was
poured into his bowl, and then Benry, with an inimitable
cunning, and a comically self-sacrificing expression on his face,
meekly enquired whether I would care to see "how much an
Ainu could drink."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "we will go down to the river, and you shall
show me there if you can drink it dry."</p>

<p>"Yie, yie, yie"&mdash;no, no, no&mdash;hurriedly replied in Japanese
the Ainu chief; "water is too heavy, and I meant wine."
Owing to this small difference of opinion, and having no wish
to encourage him in his drunkenness, Benry's capacity for
intoxicating fluids is yet unknown to the civilised world.</p>

<p>Benry's house is a palace compared to other Ainu huts. It
is much larger than most of them, and boasts of a wooden
floor, in the centre of which a rectangular fire-place is cut out.
The hut has two windows, one toward the east, the other
opening to the south; but no chimney is provided as an
outlet for the smoke. A hole in the west corner of the roof
answers this purpose. The rough wooden frame is thatched
with tall reeds and <i>arundinaria</i>, and the roof is shaped like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
a prism. The different huts of Piratori vary in size, but not
in type. The larger ones cover an area of about sixteen or
eighteen feet square. Most of them, however, do not measure
more than ten or twelve feet square. Benry's house was
exceptionally large, and being such a "swell" one, two rough
<i>kinna</i> (mats) were spread on the floor and a number of
Japanese rice boxes and <i>shokuji</i> tables<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> adorned one side of
the dwelling. Over these were hung a number of swords,
knives, etc., most of them with no blade at all, or with only a
wooden one. The few old blades which Benry possessed were
of Japanese workmanship, probably obtained by the Ainu in
their former wars with the Japanese. A few Ainu spears and
arrows with bone and bamboo poisoned points were fastened
to the roof.</p>

<p>These Ainu of Piratori have frequent intercourse with the
Japanese, who get from them furs and other articles in exchange
for <i>sake</i> or a few worthless beads. A few half-castes
are also found at Piratori. The Piratori Ainu, with those of
Volcano Bay, as we have seen, are those best known to the
civilised world, as a few foreigners have travelled so far to
see them. I may mention that as types the inhabitants of
Piratori are a great deal better than the residents of Volcano
Bay, most of whom are half-breeds; but even they themselves
cannot be taken as fair specimens of their race, for they have
adopted several customs and habits of the Japanese, which the
incautious traveller has then reported as purely Ainu customs.
For instance, the pure Ainu diet consists almost entirely of
fish, meat, and seaweeds. Only occasionally are the roots of
certain trees eaten. At Piratori I found that many grow and
eat millet, and corn and bad rice are also sometimes procured
from the Japanese. Benry has also gone so far in the way of
civilisation as to invest his small fortune in buying half-a-dozen
hens and a cock, with whom he shares his regal home.
These hens lay eggs according to custom, and Benry and his
"wife" eat them. As the Ainu language has no special word
for this imported kind of bird, they are known by the name
of "kikkiri."</p>

<span class="caption">BENRY, THE AINU CHIEF OF PIRATORI.</span></div>

<p>After the experience which I had had at Horobets I decided
to be more careful with my sketching. I broached the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to Benry, and asked him to sit to me for his portrait. At first
he was very reluctant, but the prospect of receiving a present
finally overcame his scruples&mdash;for he was indeed civilised in
this respect, and understood the worth of his version of the
almighty dollar to perfection&mdash;and, consenting to be sketched,
he sat&mdash;at the outset with as much courage as docility. He
produced a crown of shavings and seaweed, which he solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
placed on his head, whilst his better-half helped him on with
his regal <i>imi</i> (garments), as well as a large sword, which also
made part of his regal insignia. The crown had in front a small
bear's head roughly carved in wood, and the clothes were very
gaudy. They were made of strips of blue, white, and red cloth
sewn together. The materials used were Japanese, but they
were cut and arranged in a thoroughly Ainu pattern. Though
he began well, Benry was not a good sitter, and, like most
animals, he did not like to be stared at. He felt the weight of
a look, as it were, and it made him uncomfortable. Not many
minutes had elapsed before he became openly impatient; he
even showed his temper by flinging away his crown and his
wooden sword. On the other hand, sketching in Benry's
house was no easy matter for me. With all the respect due to
the chief of Piratori, I am bound to say that his house was not
a model of cleanliness. Those of his hairy brothers and
subjects were no better than his, and many were a great deal
worse. Fleas and other insects were so numerous that in a
few minutes I was literally covered with them, each one of
them having a peaceful and hearty meal at my expense, while
I, for the sake of art, had to go on with my sketch and leave
them undisturbed. Notwithstanding all this Benry was immortalised
twice that day, and his maid, housekeeper, or wife&mdash;three
words which have the same meaning to the Ainu&mdash;was
also handed down to posterity while in the act of spinning
the inner fibre of the <i>Ulmus campestris</i> bark, destined to form
a new garment for her lord, master, and husband.</p>

<p>When I went out to sketch the houses and storehouses in
the village Benry and another man followed me everywhere;
but neither he nor his fellow-shadow seemed to take any
interest in the sketching. In Japan, Corea, and China I have
often been surrounded by hundreds of people attentively
watching every stroke of the brush, and I have always found
them clever and quick in making out the meaning of each line
or brush-mark. I can assert, without fear of being contradicted,
that the majority of Japanese, Coreans, and Chinese
are even quicker than Europeans in that respect, owing to the
fact that lines constitute for them the study of a lifetime.
Chinese characters, which are nothing but a deep study of
lines, are adopted by the three above-mentioned nations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
I consider this to be the original cause why this artistic
insight is to be found even among the lowest classes. The
Ainu have no such insight; they have no characters, no
writing of any kind, no books, and it is therefore not astonishing
that they are not trained to understand art, bad as it may
have been in my case. Their appreciation of lines is yet in the
rudest form, and they possess no more than what is instinctive
with them. For instance, while I was sketching, Benry and
his friend either sat or crouched down by my side like two
dogs, and when my sketch was finished I showed it to them.</p>

<p>"Pirika, Pirika! Nishpa!" ("Very pretty, very pretty, sir!")
Benry exclaimed with perfect self-assurance; but when I
asked him what he thought the sketch represented, he cut me
short by saying that <i>I</i> had done the picture and <i>I</i> ought to
know what it was meant for; he did not. His friend agreed
with him.</p>

<p>When my work was done we three walked back to Benry's
house, my two Ainu friends being very anxious that I
should get something to eat. From their conversation and
gestures I caught that it seemed incomprehensible to them
that I should sit in front of an Ainu hut and&mdash;to use their
expression&mdash;"make all sorts of signs on a wooden panel."
After a lengthy discussion the two came to the conclusion that
houses in our country were so bad that I had been sent to the
Ainu country to "copy" the pattern of Ainu huts!</p>

<p>Benry seemed excited about something, and hurried us
back with curious haste and eagerness. When we left the
house in the morning I saw Benry's better-half placing a few
eggs in water to boil over the fire. When we entered the hut,
nearly two hours afterwards, the eggs were still boiling, and
no fair maid within yelling reach. In order that the fire
might not go out during her absence the thoughtful girl had
placed the largest portion of the trunk of a tree in the
fireplace!</p>

<p>Taken altogether, Benry and all his Saru Ainu are very
good-natured. They gradually got accustomed to being
sketched, seeing that after all it really did not bring on them
"immediate death."</p>

<p>The more one sees of the Ainu the dirtier they appear, but
as dirt to a great extent contributes to picturesqueness, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
indeed sorry when Benry, exercising his authority, sent several
of my sitters to dress up in their best clothes&mdash;often Japanese&mdash;while
I should have preferred to sketch them in their every-day
rags. I must say, for their sake, that they were never
sent to wash. Being a rapid sketcher, I had recourse to a
trick. I pretended to sketch one given person, who, of course,
was sent at once to "dress up," and while he or she, after
having returned, posed patiently for half an hour or more, I in
the meantime took sketches of four or five different natives,
who were not aware that they were being portrayed. As the
Ainu&mdash;and they are probably not the only people&mdash;could not
make either head or tail of my sketches, my trick was never
found out.</p>

<p>One day, old Benry led me by the hand in the most affectionate
manner to a hut some way off, and confidentially told
me that we were going to see his favourite girl and her boy.</p>

<p>"This," said the chief triumphantly as we went in, "this is
Benry's <i>Pirika menoko</i>" (pretty girl), "and that"&mdash;pointing to
a youth&mdash;"her only son."</p>

<p>"And what about the old hairy lady in your own hut?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"That is my <i>Poromachi</i>" (great wife), said he, qualifying
matters with a compliment to the elder woman, "and this is
my <i>Pon-machi</i>" (small wife).</p>

<p>"Why should you have two wives, you old Mormon?"</p>

<p>"Nishpa," retorted he, "my great wife is old, and she is
only fit to do all the rough work in the house and out. My
hair is white, but I am strong, and I wanted yet a young wife."</p>

<p>Indeed, there was enough mother-wit in Benry to have
made him either a scamp or a philosopher. His theories were
as remarkable as they were accommodating, particularly to
himself.</p>

<p>Returning from the house of his love, the chief was in a very
talkative mood, and he related two or three Japanese stories,
which he wanted me to believe to be pure Ainu legends. A
learned missionary and two or three travellers before him,
who had visited Piratori previous to myself, have accepted
these so-called legends wholesale, taking Benry's word for
their accuracy, which, as the old chief speaks very good
Japanese, of course simplified the task of understanding and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
transcribing them. I was, however, much surprised to find
that such learned Europeans could yield such ready credence
to a barbarian Ainu chief.</p>

<p>Thinking that it would please me, Benry told me the story
of a deluge and a big flood, in which nearly all the Ainu were
drowned. The few that escaped did so by finding refuge on a
high mountain.</p>

<p>"Where did you learn this story, Benry?" I asked sternly.</p>

<p>"Nishpa, it is an old Ainu story, and all strangers who
come to Piratori write it in their books."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Benry, you know well that <i>one</i> stranger did not
write it in his book," said I quickly, as if I knew all about it.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, nishpa; <i>that</i> was the stranger who told me the
story!"</p>

<p>This small anecdote shows how careful one ought to be in
accepting information which may sound extremely interesting
at first, but is absolutely worthless in the end.</p>

<span class="caption">AN AINU FESTIVAL.</span></div>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="small">An Ainu Festival.</span></h2>


<p>The Ainu have few public performances, and no special time
of the year is fixed for them. As it so happened, a festival&mdash;a
"Iyomanrei"&mdash;took place while I was at Piratori.</p>

<p>The performance was held in a large hut belonging to the
heir apparent to the chieftainship of Piratori. I went to the
hut and asked whether I could attend the performance. The
host, in answer, came to meet me at the door, and, taking me
by the hand, led me in. I was shown where to sit, on the
southern side of the hut, the place of honour for strangers, and
my host sat in front of me and saluted me in Ainu fashion.</p>

<p>Benry and several old men were squatting on the floor,
Benry in the middle, and he was again gorgeous in his regal
clothes. Some of the others, who wore a crown like Benry's,
were chiefs of the neighbouring villages, who had come up for
the grand occasion.</p>

<p>One by one all the men present rose and came to stroke
their hair and beard before me, and I returned the compliment
as well as I could in Ainu fashion. The hut was gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
getting filled, and each man that entered first saluted the
landlord, then Benry, then myself, and ultimately the two
guests between whom he sat. Women and children occupied
the darker west end of the hut, and they took no active part in
the function. Other chiefs came in, and Benry was surrounded
by many of them and by elderly men.</p>

<p>The whole group of these chiefs, with their long white
beards, lighted up by a brilliant ray of sunshine, which
penetrated through the small east window, was extremely
picturesque.</p>

<p>In its savagery it was almost grand, with a barbaric quasi-animal
sense of power and irresponsibility. In truth, it was a
wonderful sight to see all these hairy people assembled in this
small place&mdash;men, yet not men like ourselves&mdash;men, and not
brutes, yet still having curiously brutish traits athwart their
humanity.</p>

<p>The performance was simple, but really fine in its simplicity.
A fire burning in the centre of the hut, and filling the place
with smoke, added, by its suggestive dimness, to the picturesqueness
of the scene. It was strange that the only ray of
sun which came in should fall on the most interesting group.
Was it chance or design? Rembrandt himself would have
delighted in painting that scene.</p>

<p>Benry looked every inch a king, and several of the younger
men were busily engaged lighting his pipe and refilling it with
tobacco. He puffed away at such a rate that no sooner was
the pipe filled than it was smoked and handed over again to
undergo the same process.</p>

<p>Two large casks of Japanese <i>sake</i> were brought in, and each
man produced his wooden bowl.</p>

<p>The host came slowly forward, and planted an <i>Inao</i>&mdash;a
willow wand with overhanging shavings&mdash;in one corner of the
fireplace; then muttered a few words, which implied that the
<i>sake</i> could now be poured out. A Japanese lacquer rice-box
was filled with the intoxicating liquid, and no sooner had this
been done than old Benry, forgetting his dignity, jumped up
and made a rush for it, filled a large bowl, and retired to a
corner to drink it. All the men present followed his example.
Benry was never selfish when he had had enough for himself.
He filled his bowl again and brought it to me, saying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
I was a friend of the Ainu, and must join them in the
drinking.</p>

<p>My attention was suddenly drawn to three old chiefs, who,
half drunk, stood in front of the small east window. They
dipped their moustache-lifters in their bowls, waving them
towards the sun as a salutation to the "Chop Kamui," the
"Great Sun." There was no religious character attached to
this libation offered to the sun, no more than when we take off
our hats passing a respected friend in the street. It is a mere
sign of respect, not of worship. Besides, it must be clearly
understood that no "offerings" of wine are ever made by the
Ainu to the "Great Sun," and that the "libations" offered
are invariably consumed by the offerer.</p>

<p>I managed to get several sketches of the assembly, and
every moment I expected to get into trouble again; but this
time they took it most kindly.</p>

<p>The hut became very stuffy, owing to the large number of
persons and the smoke. There were nearly two hundred
people in it, packed closely together, and there was nothing in
the show to interest one&mdash;certainly not the disgusting sight of
this drunkenness, which, moreover, became monotonous as
well as disgusting.</p>

<p>I stroked my hair and beard&mdash;the latter only figuratively&mdash;in
sign of salute, to the host, Benry, and the other drowsy
chiefs, and, carefully avoiding pushing or treading on any
member of the unsteady crowd, I made my exit.</p>

<p>Oh, what a treat it was to breathe fresh air again!</p>

<p>Outside the hut the pretty <i>menokos</i> (girls) of Piratori were
having a lot of fun all to themselves. They were all dressed
in long yellowish gowns, with rough white and red ornamentations
on a patch of blue cloth, on their backs; and each girl
took a very active part in a game, or a kind of savage dance,
called Tapkara. They all ranged themselves in a circle, and
a child or two was sometimes placed in the centre. The game
consisted in collectively hopping an indefinite number of times,
calling out either the name, or the accompanying sound, of
some of their everyday occupations, and clapping the hands so
as to keep time. For instance, one sound was "Ouye, ouye"
("Fire, fire"), and they all blew as when making a fire, and
hopped till they were nearly senseless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Then the next was "R-r-r, r-r-r, r-r-r," and with this they
imitated the pulling of a rope.</p>

<p>Then "Pirrero, pirrero; pirrero, pirrero," was the sound
accompanying the action of rowing, imitating the squeaking of
the paddle produced by the friction on the canoe.</p>

<p>The movement of the arms changed according to the sounds
uttered, but the hopping was kept up continuously. The
game reminded me much of our Sir Roger de Coverley, in a
more barbarous form, but certainly not less pretty than our
old country dance.</p>

<span class="caption">AINU WOMEN DANCING, PIRATORI.</span></div>

<p>Late in the afternoon all the men came out of the hut, and
by a winding path I was taken to the valley along the river,
at the foot of the cliff on which Piratori is built. Benry and
all the other chiefs remained on the cliff. Bareback races
formed the next and last event in the programme, and the
chiefs were to witness them from their "high point of view."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 162px;">
<img src="images/illus-034.jpg" width="162" height="310" alt="" title="PIRATORI WOMAN IN COSTUME" />
<span class="caption">PIRATORI WOMAN IN COSTUME.</span></div>

<p>There was great excitement as to who should ride the
ponies. The Ainu are fond of sports, and I noticed that
ultimately they were sharp enough to select their jockeys from
among the lightest men. The winner of each race had a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
time of it, but the other unfortunate jockeys were pulled off
the ponies by the angry mob, and knocked about as worthless
beings.</p>

<p>The evening came, and with the dying sun ended that
memorable day of festivities. I retired. Distant sounds of
the <i>menokos</i>, still enjoying themselves, came to me with the
wind, but fainter and fainter they grew as it was getting
darker.</p>

<p>"Pirrero! Pirrero! Pirrero!" I heard again, till at last the
sounds faded away into a mere murmur, and I fell asleep.</p>

<p>The morning that I left Piratori, old Benry put on his regal
clothes and crown to bid me good-bye.</p>

<p>"Nishpa, Popka-no-okkayan"
("Sir, may you be preserved
warm"), said the old chief, in the
Ainu fashion of bidding farewell;
"I have a pain in my chest,
owing to your leaving Piratori,
but I shall accompany you part
of the way."</p>

<p>I dissuaded the old chief from
doing that, but he went on, with
his plaintive voice: "Nishpa,
you must tell in your country
that Piratori is a nice place, and
all the Ainu are good people.
Not like the Shamo" (Japanese;
also half-breeds), "for they are
bad. You must return soon,"
he added, and, taking my hand,
he pressed it to his hairy chest.
He then took me to his hut
again, and there renewed his
farewells, and I renewed mine to
him, to his <i>great</i> wife, and to his house, for it is part of the
Ainu etiquette to bid good-bye to the house of a friend as
well as to the owner of it.</p>

<p>The return journey to Saru Mombets was accomplished
without much difficulty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="small">From the Saru River to Cape Erimo.</span></h2>


<p>After quitting Saru Mombets I was altogether out of the
beaten tracks. The twenty-two miles to Shimokebo were
monotonous in the extreme. High cliffs towered above me
on the one side, and the sea stretched into infinity on the
other. River after river had to be waded, the At-pets,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the
Nii-pak-pets,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the Shibe-gari-pets.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The Nii-pak-pets is
wide and fairly deep. Near the At-pets river the Japanese
Government has established a horse farm, in order to improve
the breed of Yezo ponies. A few miserable Ainu huts are
scattered along the coast, and millions of scavenger crows,
with their monotonous cries, seem to claim sovereignty over
these shores. Near the Takae village, on the Nii-kap-pets, is
an enormous perpendicular cliff, which, jutting out into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
sea, bars the way to the traveller; therefore I had to abandon
the sandy shore, and with considerable trouble get the ponies
to climb over the steep banks, which was no easy task for them.
Shimokebo is a peculiar-looking place. It is entirely a fishermen's
village, and I put up at the Ogingawa Zunubi yadoya&mdash;a
tea-house owned by a Japanese fisherman.</p>

<p>Japanese will be Japanese wherever they go, and people who
have had anything to do with them know how difficult it is to
satisfy their curiosity.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" inquired the <i>occamisan</i>&mdash;the landlady.
"Where do you come from? What is your country? Why
are you travelling? Have you a wife and children? Can you
eat Japanese food; also Ainu food? Can you sleep in
<i>foutangs</i>?" (Japanese bedding). "Also with a <i>makura</i>?" (a
wooden pillow).</p>

<p>About fifty more personal and indiscreet questions were also
asked, and all my belongings were examined with ever-increasing
astonishment as one thing after another was handled
and investigated. I was tired, and felt as if I could have
kicked the whole crowd of them out of my room; but I was
unintentionally polite to them to such an extent that the
<i>occamisan</i> loudly exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Honto Danna, Anata Nihonno shto, onaji koto!</i>"&mdash;"Really,
sir, you are just like a Japanese!"</p>

<p>"<i>Domo neh!</i>" rose up in a chorus from the large assembly,
"<i>nandemo dannasan wakarimas!</i>"&mdash;"The gentleman really
understands everything!" This was a decided compliment,
and I was bound to accept it as it was intended. When they
heard that I was indeed "<i>Taihen kutabire mashita</i>" (very
tired), they reluctantly left the room, and closed the <i>shoji</i>
(sliding doors of tissue paper on a wooden frame). Each
bowed gracefully, drawing in his breath at the same time.
This is the Japanese polite way of leaving a room. Their
conversation was resumed in the next apartment, regardless of
the fact that tissue paper walls are not sound-proof. Remarks
on me, not quite in harmony with their courteous bearing,
were passed freely about, and the politest thing I heard them
say was that I must be a <i>lunatic</i> to travel alone in these inhospitable
regions, and what a pity it was for a man <i>so young</i> to
be so fearfully afflicted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
"Oh, those <i>seyono shto</i> (foreigners) are all born lunatics,"
said the voice of one who knew better.</p>

<p>The Shibegari River, at the mouth of which Shimokebo is
situated, is also called Shibe-chari&mdash;"sprinkled salmon river."
Very minute traces of gold are found in the river-sands and
gravels, and also some well-developed brown garnet crystals
and quartzite and phyllite pebbles. The gold, however, is not
in sufficient quantity to enable it to be worked profitably.
Seven and a half miles from Shimokebo the Japanese Government
has another horse farm similar to that of the At-pets.</p>

<p>The travelling along the coast was heavy, and I could ride
but slowly. I had to make the ponies go where the sand was
wet along the beach, as there it was harder and they did not
sink. This had its drawbacks, for the sea was very rough, and
once or twice my ponies and I came very near being washed
against the cliffs by some extra large wave. Instead of green
banks, as between Tomakomai and Shimokebo, here were
high cliffs of volcanic formation, with a narrow strip of sand at
their foot.</p>

<p>The few Ainu along the coast were decidedly ugly. It was
only now and then that in a sheltered nook I came across
a hut or two of seaweed gatherers; and, still following the
cliffs, I passed two or three small villages of a few houses each.
After fifteen miles of this heavy track I reached the fishing
station of Ubahu, where I was able to obtain some fresh
horses. Prowling along the beach, I examined some of the
Ainu canoes that had been drawn on shore. They might be
divided into three classes&mdash;(<i>a</i>) the "dug-outs," used mostly
for river navigation; (<i>b</i>) the lashed canoe; and (<i>c</i>) a larger
kind used for sailing. The "dug-out" does not require explanation,
as everyone knows that it is a trunk of a tree
hollowed out in the shape of a boat, and propelled either
by paddling or punting.</p>

<span class="caption">FRONT VIEW OF
LASHED CANOE.</span></span>
The lashed canoes are made of nine pieces of wood lashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
together with the fibre of a kind of vine. The concave bottom
is all of one piece&mdash;a partial "dug-out"&mdash;to which are added
the side pieces, of three planks each, sewn together at an angle
of about 170°, and made to fit the sides of the "dug-out."
Two more pieces, one aft and one forward, meet the side
planks at right angles. The length of these
canoes varies from 10 to 15 feet, the width
from 3 to 3½ feet. Two pieces of wood are
then lashed horizontally, which answer the
double purpose of strengthening the sides of
the canoe and, being provided with pins outside
the canoe, of allowing it to be used
as an outrigger when rowing. Canoes are either rowed or
sailed. The oars are made of two pieces firmly lashed
<span class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-038b.png" width="600" height="51" alt="AINU OARS" />
<span class="caption">AINU OARS.</span></span>
together. A hole is bored in the part which is to be passed
through the pin in the outrigger. One person is generally
sufficient to row an Ainu canoe, and he does so standing.
There is no steering gear or rudder, and when rowing the oars
are used for that purpose. Ainu canoes are not decked, and
therefore cannot stand heavy seas. They are alike on both
sides, and in most cases the two ends of the canoe are also
shaped alike. There are, however, certain canoes which, in
my opinion, have been suggested to the Ainu by Japanese
boats, and which are flat at the stern. These are generally
larger, and used for sailing. A square mat sail is rigged on a

<span class="caption">SAILING CANOE.</span></span>
short mast forward, and the steering is done with one of the
oars at the stern. The sailing qualities of these canoes,
however, are not very great, and the slightest squall causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
them to capsize and "turn turtle." The anchors used by the
Ainu are very ingenious; they are cut out of a piece of wood,

<span class="caption">AINU WOODEN ANCHORS.</span></span>
with either one or two barbs, and
two stones are fastened on the
sides of the stem so as to carry
the anchor to the bottom. No
compass is either known or
used by the Ainu, and the
natives shape their course by sight of land. They very
seldom go long distances out at sea, as they are fully aware of
the dangers of the ocean and of the imperfection of their
own methods of navigation, though they are wholly incapable
of making any improvements by their own judgment. The
canoes are always beached when not used, and each family
possesses its own. There are none which are the property
of companies or are common to certain villages.</p>

The track between Ubahu and Urakawa is rough, and the
rivers are somewhat troublesome. Not far from the Mitsuashi
river one has to pass a tunnel which has been made
through a rock projecting into the sea. In rough weather
it is difficult and dangerous to get through, as the waves
wash right through the tunnel. In fair weather it affords
a safe passage to the traveller.</p>

<p>The Matourabets (the winter fishing river) was successfully
waded, and the Ikantai<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> village passed. Then at Urakawa
or Urapets (the fish river) I made a halt for the night. There
are many half-breeds at Urakawa, and a few real Ainu, but
the small population is composed mostly of Japanese
fishermen.</p>

<p>Seven and a half miles further, at Shama-ne&mdash;a corruption
of <i>Shuna</i>, stones, and <i>ne</i>, together&mdash;there are some magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
granite pillars boldly standing out of the sea. The sandy beach
came to an end, and huge cliffs barred my way in front. I
could see that the water was not very deep round these rocks,
as the waves were breaking a long distance from the cliff, a
sure sign of shallow water, though even then it might have
been too deep for my ponies to go through. With great
difficulty I got the two brutes into the sea, trying to round the
large rocks for the better ground, which I hoped to find on
the other side. The tide was low, but the sea was still rough,
and nearly every wave as it came in went right over my
ponies, frightening them, and made them extremely difficult
to hold. The instinct of self-preservation made them rush for
the cliff, with the only result that they missed their footing,
and they and I were both swept away by the next receding
wave. I was carried off the saddle, but I had sufficient
presence of mind to hold on to the bridle. An awful struggle
ensued between my ponies and myself. Each wave that came
carried and knocked us one way, each wave that retired carried
and knocked us the other. In the midst of all this danger I
suddenly remembered that some years ago a lady who knew all
about palmistry prophesied that I should one day be drowned.</p>

<p>Had the day come now? Not if energy and perseverance
would avert the doom! After a long struggle, I succeeded in
pulling my horses where the water was a little shallower, and
there we three stood for some minutes, trembling with cold,
my two ponies looking reproachfully at me with those half-human
eyes of animals when forced into positions of danger
which they can neither understand nor overcome. It is
wonderful the amount of expression that horses have in their
eyes, and how plainly one can read their dumb thoughts and
formless emotions!</p>

<p>From the point where I was standing I could see that I had
to go on but a few hundred feet more, and that then my ponies
and I would be safe. Sure enough, the water grew shallower
and shallower, and, to my delight, I was soon on the other side
of the cliff. At high tide, and in very rough weather, it is
impossible to pass by this ocean-ford.</p>

<p>Shamane is a picturesque little fishing village, built on the
side of a promontory jutting out into the sea. From there,
looking towards Urakawa, there is a lovely view of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
small islands and picturesque rocks, standing like huge jewels
in the water, while on the Horoizumi side, as far as the eye can
see, there are only cliffs of peculiar shapes, and marvellously
rich in colour.</p>

<p>I got two fresh animals, and pursued my journey towards
Horoizumi. Rocks, rocks, nothing but rocks! My ponies
stumbled and slipped all the time, and for eighteen miles the
riding was hard and intricate. I had to lead my ponies most
of the way, and help them, pull them, or push them, from one
rock on to another, and down the next, and so on.</p>

<p>The scenery all along was magnificent and grand. A short
distance from Shamane a large natural archway emerges from
the sea, which is called by the Ainu, Shui-shma, "a hole in
stone."</p>

<p>Holes have been pierced through the rocks in several
places, to give comparative safe passage, and to prevent
wayfarers from being carried away by the waves. Over the
entrance of one of these tunnels a pretty waterfall, descending
from a great height, gives a poetic effect to the scene, while it
obliges the unfortunate traveller to take an extremely cold
shower-bath, should he wish to push forward on his journey.</p>

<p>As if all these discomforts combined were not enough, it is
to be added that the rivers in this part of the coast, though not
wide, are extremely swift and dangerous to cross. My second
pony was carried away by the strong current when I crossed
the Poro-nam-bets,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and I had great difficulty in rescuing him.</p>

<p>At Shamane there are a few Ainu, but from there to
Horoizumi I saw none.</p>

<p>Sardines are very plentiful all along this coast, and long
seaweeds also abound. The latter is used for export, chiefly
to China. Horoizumi, a nice little village of one hundred
and fifty houses, is the most picturesque in Yezo. It is built
on the slopes of a high cliff, and it reminds one much of the
pretty villages in the Gulf of Spezia. I arrived at sunset,
and the warm red and yellow tints which the dying orb of
day was shedding on the weather-beaten brownish houses,
gave a heavenly appearance to this very earthly place. As
I got nearer, a good deal of the heavenly had to be discarded,
for the odours of fish-manure and of seaweed are two smells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
which can hardly claim to be classed under that heading.
The inhabitants of the place themselves seem to feel the
ill-effects of constantly living in that corrupted atmosphere
and on a fish and seaweed diet; for, indeed, it is revolting to
see the amount of horrible cutaneous diseases which affect
them. One hardly sees one creature out of ten that is not
covered with a repulsive eruption of some sort. Leprosy, too,
has found its way among the fishermen; and my readers can
easily imagine how pleasant it was for me, when I was sketching,
to be surrounded by a crowd of these loathsome people,
who all wished to touch my clothes and all my belongings,
and who would even lean on my back and rub their heads
against mine, when trying to get a better view of the sketch.</p>

<p>Poor things! I never had the courage to scold and send
them away. It was enough that they were afflicted, and I did
not like to add humiliation to their other sorrows by showing
them my disgust.</p>

<p>I rode on to Erimo-zaki, or Rat Cape. Thick fogs are
prevalent during the summer months along the whole of the
south-east coast, of which Erimo-zaki is the most southern
cape. It is the terminating point of the backbone of the
main portion of Yezo, which extends from Cape Soya to
Cape Erimo from N.NW. to S.SE. A lighthouse has lately
been erected on the cliffs by the Japanese Maritime Department,
and a steam fog-horn has also been provided for the
greater safety of navigation, as a reef of rocks and a stretch of
shallow water extend out in the sea for about two and a half
miles from the coast.</p>

<p>The foghorn, I was informed, was only blown when the
lighthouse-keeper suspected some ship was likely to make for
the rocks! A likely thing, indeed!</p>

<p>"But how are you to know, especially when there is a
thick fog on?" I asked.</p>

<p>"So few ships pass near here," was the reply; "and it
would not be much use keeping steam up all the time to blow
the horn, considering that we have fog during nearly four
months in the year."</p>

<p>"Then," I could not help remarking, "I expect you only
light the lighthouse when there is going to be a wreck?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; we show the light every night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
This was just like the Japanese! Owing to the imperfectness
of charts&mdash;none delineating correctly that part of the coast&mdash;the
strong currents, the thick fogs, and the dangerous reefs,
there could not be a more perilous coast for navigation than
that which terminates in Cape Erimo. The ships which go from
Shanghai, or some of the ports in the Petchili Gulf in China, to
North American ports, often steer this course through the
Tsugaru Strait and pass directly south of Cape Erimo. Thus
the <i>Mary Tatham</i> (an English screw-steamer), while on her
journey from Shanghai to Oregon, was lost in 1882, with nearly
all lives on board, about two miles from this cape.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Erimo cliffs is a small fishing village
called Okos. The sea is shallow at this place, and there are
many low-lying reefs which afford abundance of kelp and
seaweeds.</p>

<p>A short time before I arrived at Okos a man had gone out
in his boat to save some nets in which a large fish had got
entangled. His boat capsized, and he was drowned. His
wife was in a dreadful state of mind, not for the loss of her
better half, but for the more irreparable loss of the nets.</p>

<p>The distance between Horoizumi and Cape Erimo is seven
and a half miles, and the track is exceedingly rough in many
places. Nearly half-way between the last-mentioned village
and the cape are the three high pillars called <i>Utarop</i>, which
are represented in the illustration at the head of the chapter.</p>

<p>As it was impossible to take my ponies along the few miles
between Cape Erimo and Shoya, following the precipitous
coast, I retraced my steps to Horoizumi, meaning to attempt
the mountain pass the next morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="small">From Cape Erimo to the Tokachi River</span></h2>


<p>The mountain pass between Horoizumi and Shoya is supposed
to be very dangerous on account of bears. I rode the
ten miles quietly, but failed to meet or see any. The way
through thick woods is exceedingly pretty. After traversing
a small valley with a dense growth of scrub-bamboo, it climbs
a small hill, from the top of which a lovely view of Cape
Erimo lies like a picture before one's eyes. There are only
thirty houses at Shoya, and the place could not be better
described than by the words "a miserable hole." The rough
weather, as well as several landslips, had some time before my
arrival broken all communication between Shoya and the next
village east of it. There is a rough mountain trail as far as
Saruru, but my ponies could not possibly get through the
scrub-wood and heavy climbing, and none of the natives could
be induced to carry my luggage. They all positively refused
to follow me on account of the multitude of bears which they
said were on the mountains.</p>

<p>"If the sea goes down," said an old fisherman, "you may be
able to get through early to-morrow morning at low tide; and,
if you are careful, you will not be washed away by the waves."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
The cliffs near Shoya are remarkable for their beauty. They
are mostly older eruptive rocks which nature has carved into
hundreds of rugged and fantastic forms. About a mile from
the village is a huge natural archway, and from this point
begin the precipitous cliffs, pillars, and rocks which make the
journey so difficult.</p>

<p>At Shoya there are no pure Ainu, but some of the fishermen
exhibit traces of Ainu blood. My recollection of Shoya
is decidedly not of a pleasant character. I put up in the
house of a fisherman, which also answers the purpose of a tea-house
for the few stranded native travellers.</p>

<p>"We are so poor," said the landlord when I asked for something
to eat, "and we have finished our provisions of rice.
The other people in the village are poorer than we are, and
they also have none; and as for fish, the sea has been so
rough for several days that we have not been able to catch
any. We ate the last scrap of fish we had just before you
arrived! If you gave me a fortune, I could not give you anything
to eat."</p>

<p>When the landlord confessed this to me in the evening,
I had already been fourteen hours without food. The prospect
of not getting any more for at least the next eighteen or
twenty hours was not an agreeable look-out. I was very
hungry, but, failing a meal, the next best thing was to try and
go to sleep. Even that did not prove successful, for hunger
keeps you awake, and in its first stages sharpens all your
senses considerably.</p>

<p>The night I spent at Shoya is worthy of a description.
From top to bottom the corners of my room were filled with
webs, which the spiders had spun undisturbed in all directions
across the room. Hundreds of flies and horseflies rose buzzing
when I entered the room, and I had to engage in a very
unequal war against them before I could settle down on the
hard planks. In one corner of the ceiling a big, long-legged
spider, too high for me to reach, was enjoying a good meal
out of a huge horsefly which he had captured in his net.
I almost envied the long-legged epicure. Nature will be
ironical sometimes. When night came, and I was still sleepless,
the planks on which I was lying seemed harder than any
planks I had ever slept on before. I turned round one way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
then the other, then another, till all my bones were aching.
Finally, through exhaustion, I fell asleep, and even had a
nightmare. In my dreams, the ghosts of all the spiders
I had killed, magnified to the size of human beings,
were dancing round me, while one fat old fellow&mdash;fatter
than any two others put together&mdash;was gravely sitting
on my chest watching the performance. His weight was
such that I was nearly suffocated. Sometimes he would
seize me by the throat and almost choke me, while the
dancing spiders would choke themselves with laughing ...
when&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Hayaku Danna!</i>"&mdash;"Quick, sir!" said a Japanese voice,
waking me suddenly; "get up, or else the tide will rise, and
you will not be able to get to Saruru."</p>

<p>I opened my eyes; the dream passed, and the monstrous
spiders vanished; but the pain caused by the emptiness
of my stomach was still there, and my throat was dry and
aching.</p>

<p>It was before sunrise, and it was almost in complete darkness
that I left Shoya. I was weak and chilly. The monotonous
sound of the waves breaking over the shore added
melancholy to <i>malaise</i>, and made me very doleful and limp.
Nevertheless, as I was in for it, I pushed my way with my
ponies along high cliffs and among rocks, and got on as best
I could.</p>

<p>Where the sea had receded the stones were slippery, and
my two animals were no sooner on their feet than they were
down again on their knees. The hollow sound of their hoofs
on the rocks was echoed from cliff to cliff, and awakened the
sleepy crows from their night's repose. I had to walk most of
the way, and urge on my ponies with howls, as well as stir
them up with the whip. Though the tide was low, the waves
often washed up to my waist. Daylight came, and I went
along, following the high, rugged cliffs, through tunnels
occasionally, among rocks continually. The scenery was
really magnificent, seen as it was in the mysterious morning
light of the rising sun. My horses were done up when I got
to Saruru, and I exchanged them for fresh ones. By this
time the tide had risen, and it was not possible to proceed
any further along the sea-shore. I was glad of it, as I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
thus be forced to try the mountain track, which I was told
was not so very rough from this point. A half-caste offered
to show me the way. It was a very stiff climb among thick
shrub, but it was comparatively smooth work after the
experience of my journey from Shoya. I came across many
tracks and footprints of bears on the mountain. In some
places the marks were quite fresh and of different sizes,
varying in length from one foot to four inches. The half-caste
told me that black bears seldom attack men unless they are
hungry. They often attack horses.</p>

<p>"But if they hear that a man is near they will not dare to
attack even the horses," he said, and then began to sing at the
top of his voice. His singing, half Japanese, half Ainu, was
so excruciating that it was no wonder to me that it kept the
bears away.</p>

<p>We crossed two rapid streams before reaching the summit
of the mountain range. The view from the summit was
lovely. In the distance I could distinguish two headlands,
while an immense stretch of stormy sea and a high
mountain were in the foreground. I began to descend,
and again I got into the region of thick forest and scrub.
I perceived a few houses near the coast, and we made for
them. It was the village of Moyoro,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> or Biru, as it is called
by others.</p>

<p>Between Saruru and Biru, where the mountain track sometimes
descends to the shore, I found many Ainu and half-breeds,
especially in the two villages of Onnito<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and Bitatannuki.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
They are said to be very bad, and what I saw of
them, even at Biru, corroborated this assertion.</p>

<p>Biru is situated on a small bay, in the centre of which some
gigantic pillars stand out at a great height. The rough sea
dashes against them, and thousands of crows and sea-birds
have chosen these rocks for their abode. Biru is not a large
village. There are only forty fishermen's huts, most of
which are on the high cliff surrounding the small bay; the
others are down on the beach. Kelp, seaweed, and sardines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
are as abundant here as on the south-west coast, and
maintain the staple industries of the inhabitants. The sea-weed
is of great length but small width. Fourteen more
miles over the cliffs brought me to Perohune.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> There
were four large deltas to cross, that of the Toyoi-pets<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
being the largest. The current in all these rivers is extremely
swift.</p>

<p>Perohune enjoys a big name, but there is only one house in
the place. I was, however, fortunate enough to get two good
ponies there. The fog was settling down thicker and thicker,
and I could not see more than a yard or two in front of me;
but at times it lifted up for a few moments, and showed me
either the dangers I was nearing or the landscape I was losing.
I passed two lakes, the Tobuts,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> otherwise called Oputs, and
the Yuto. Both are divided from the sea by a narrow sand-ridge.
There is but little of human interest along this deserted
coast. There are no houses and no people, but many small
rivers, and now and then high cliffs. My ponies, driven mad
by the <i>abus</i>, the terrible horseflies of Yezo, constantly threw
themselves down and rolled on the sand.</p>

<p>From Perohune to Yuto Lake the distance is about eleven
miles, and from Yuto to Otsu it is eleven more miles, on a
very easy track. I saw some large sea-birds and penguins,
and I was struck by the great number of drift logs which had
been washed on shore by the sea. The last thirty-eight
miles of the coast was literally covered with this drift wood.
During the summer months the fog is always dense along this
coast, greatly owing to a cold current which comes from the
Otkoshk Sea, passes through the strait between Kunashiri
and Etorofu, in the Kuriles, and then turns south, following a
great part of the south-east coast of Yezo. Not far from
Erimo Cape it meets a warm current from the China Sea,
which passes through the Tsugaru Strait, and which in all
probability is the Kuro-shiwo, or Japan current. This Japan
current parts from the main stream near the south-western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
extremity of Japan, goes through the Corean Strait, and
follows the north-west coast of Nippon, passing then through
the Tsugaru Strait. As will be seen later, a branch of this
current runs along the north-west coast of Yezo, and through
the La Perouse Strait.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="small">The Tokachi Region&mdash;Pure Ainu Types&mdash;Curious Mode of River
Fishing.</span></h2>


<p>The Tokachi River is one of the largest and most important
in Yezo. Knowing that the Ainu either settle on the sea-shore
or up river-courses, I formed an idea that some good
types were to be found up this river. On reaching Otsu, a
small settlement at the mouth of the Otsugawa&mdash;a branch of
the large delta formed by the Tokachi&mdash;my idea was confirmed
by the report that there were no Japanese villages in the
interior. The expedition up the Tokachi River was by no
means easy from the accounts I heard at Otsu. None of the
Japanese ever dare to penetrate into the interior from Otsu,
and, so far as foreigners are concerned, the Tokachi River was
utterly unexplored. There is a certain charm in being the
first man to do something, and I decided to attempt the
experiment. The Japanese of Otsu dissuaded me strongly
from carrying out my plan; for they said the grass and reeds
were so high that I could not possibly get through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
"It is a kind of a jungle, in fact," said they, "in which yellow
and black bears are plentiful. The rivers, which are numerous,
are swollen by the heavy rains that have fallen lately. The
natives up the river are unsociable and bad, and they will kill
you. Then in the high grass horse-flies, black-flies, and mosquitoes
abound."</p>

<p>"If you attempt it alone," said the wise man of the party,
"you will not come back alive."</p>

<p>These reports were not encouraging, but, anyhow, I determined
that, Irish as it may sound, <i>dead</i> or <i>alive</i>, if there were
any Ainu up the stream I would see them. Owing to the
difficulty of taking even my usual baggage, and not wishing
to burden my ponies with more than was necessary, I decided
to carry with me only a paint-box, many wooden sketching
panels, my diary, and my revolver. I left all my other things
at Otsu to wait for my return.</p>

<p>"Should you not come back again, can I keep all your
belongings as my property?" kindly enquired the landlord of
the tea-house, when I bade good-bye to him and to all the
villagers who had collected round early in the morning to see
me start.</p>

<p>I took two ponies, as usual. I left Otsu at dawn, and
followed as well as I could the winding course of the river.
Not far from Otsu I came to the thick jungle of high reeds
and tall grass of which I had already heard. I made my way
through the first obstructions; but I had not been in the jungle
more than a few minutes when I was simply devoured by
horse-flies, mosquitoes, and black-flies. My ponies were kicking,
bucking, and trying to bolt, as they also were literally
covered with horse-flies, sucking their blood and stinging them
to madness. The reeds and grass were about ten or twelve
feet high, so that, being higher than myself on my horse, I
could not see where I was going. I kept along the river bank
as much as I could; but in many places it was difficult to get
through the ravines which one invariably finds along rivers,
so I kept a little way off on the west side, and had the noise
of the running river to guide me. For many wearisome hours
I rode through this jungle, the dividing reeds continually
rubbing against my face, arms, and legs, sometimes making
pretty deep cuts with their razor-edged long leaves. The huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<i>shirau</i>&mdash;the horse-flies&mdash;grew more and more tiresome as the
sun got warmer, and my head and hands were swollen and
bleeding. The sun was by this time high in the sky, but there
were no signs of the jungle coming to an end, no indications
of huts anywhere near&mdash;no other noise but the sound of the
crashing reeds and the running water of the river. My ponies
were feeding well, as grass was plentiful; but I was faring
badly. What with the exertion of keeping the ponies in
order, while the densely-entangled reeds nearly dragged me off
the saddle&mdash;what with the plague of mosquitoes and horse-flies,
added to the sense of weakness caused by fatigue and hunger&mdash;it
was really a terrible time for me&mdash;one of the worst
episodes in my life. Nevertheless, I persevered, and went on
and on, determined to reach my destination. I came upon
two very large swamps, which forced me to make a wide
<i>détour</i>. The ponies were very tired, and so was I. When
darkness set in I halted, took the heavy pack-saddles off the
ponies, and tied the animals to them, so that they could not
bolt during the night; and wearied, disheartened, and discouraged
as I was, I began to think how stupid I had been to
start on such an expedition without carrying any provisions
with me&mdash;without having provided myself with even a tent or
a covering of any kind.</p>

<p>Circumstances made me a philosopher. What is the use of
worrying about things that cannot be helped? After all,
when you get accustomed to it, starving is really not so bad
as people think. One of my ponies was of a sentimental
disposition, and he seemed to understand my troubles. He
came close and rubbed himself against me, placing his head
near mine. It was touching, and in the solitude in which I
was the sympathy of the dumb beast was as precious as that
of a human being. Had he been able to speak, he might
have been taken for a Christian, and a good one, too! He
had been fearfully stung by horse-flies, and my petting him
seemed to alleviate his pain. There is nothing like sympathy
and a little personal kindness if one wants to make friends with
animals. The last few rays of light were spent in putting
together the notes which I had taken during the day, and
which enabled me to draw a sketch-map of the river. At
Horoizumi some days previously I was able to buy myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
a compass from a Japanese fisherman, and on this occasion it
was extremely useful to me.</p>

<p>By the soft, or rather shrill, music of a full orchestra of
mosquitoes I fell asleep. It was poetic, but not comfortable.
Strange noises woke me several times during the night. My
ponies also were very restless, and repeatedly tried to get
loose while I was lying down on the two saddles to which they
were fastened.</p>

<p>It was some time after sunrise when I woke up, and with
stiff bones set off again. A heavy dew had fallen during the
night, and had made my clothes very damp. The reeds and
grass also were saturated with water, and riding through them
caused a continuous shower to fall over me, giving me an
uncomfortable and by no means efficient kind of shower bath.</p>

<p>I rode in a westerly direction till about two or three in the
afternoon, when suddenly the jungle came to an end. Not
only that, but a short distance away I saw some Ainu huts.
I soon reached them, dismounted, and tied my ponies to a tree.
I went to the first hut, and previous to going in I called out:
"Hem, hem, hem, hem!" which in the Ainu country is the
polite preliminary when a stranger wishes to enter a hut. The
usual practice of <i>knocking</i> at the door is dispensed with, for
Ainu doorways have <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Corrected from the original 'do'.">no</span> doors.</p>

<p>"Hem, hem, hem, hem, hem!" called I again much louder,
but I heard no answer; so I lifted the mat and entered the
hut. It was empty. No one was there. I came out again,
and went into the next hut, into another, and yet another; but
nobody was to be found. I supposed that they were all out
fishing. From the roof in each hut was hanging some dried
and half-dried salmon. I could not resist the temptation after
nearly thirty-four hours of involuntary fasting; and I stole&mdash;I
mean "conveyed," or helped myself to the largest fish. I
was greedily eating it&mdash;and how good it was!&mdash;when I thought
I heard a groan inside the hut. I listened, and I distinctly
heard some one sniffing in a corner of the dark dwelling. Had
I been caught stealing? The crime I had committed would
be called felony at home, but in the Ainu country it has not
nearly so bad a name as that. However, felony or not, I
dropped the fish, or rather what remained of it, and made for
the corner whence the noise came. As I got closer I discerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
a mass of white hair and two claws, almost like thin human
feet with long hooked nails. A few fish-bones scattered on the
ground and a lot of filth were massed together in that corner;
and the disgusting odours these exhaled were beyond measure
horrible.</p>

<p>"What the devil is that!" I said aloud in my own native
tongue. I could hear someone breathing heavily under that
mass of white hair, but I could not make out the shape of a
human body. I touched the hair, I pulled it, and with a groan,
and movements similar to those of a snake uncoiling itself,
two thin bony arms suddenly stretched out and clasped my
hand. As my eyes were getting accustomed to the dim light
I thought I saw some almost worn-out tattoo marks on her
arms. Yes, it was a woman in that corner, though her limbs
were merely skin and bone, and her long hair and long nails
gave her a ghastly appearance. Indeed, crouched as she was,
doubled up, with her head on her knees, and the long hair
falling over her face and shoulders, it was really difficult to
make out what she was.</p>

<p>I asked her to come out, but she was apparently deaf and
dumb. I dragged her out, and she made but little resistance;
only she preferred crawling on her hands and knees to
walking upright on her feet. There is no accounting for
people's tastes, and I let her please herself in her manner of
locomotion. When she was fairly out in the light I shivered
as I looked at the miserable being before me. I lifted up her
hair to see the face. Her eyebrows were thick and shaggy,
and were joined over the nose. Her eyes were half closed, and
dead-looking. The strong light seemed to affect her, and with
her hands she was feeling the ground, probably in order to
retrace her steps back to the dark spot. Nature could not
have inflicted more evils on that wretched creature. She was
nearly blind, deaf, and dumb; she apparently suffered from
rheumatism, which had doubled up her body and stiffened
her bony arms and legs; and, moreover, she showed many
of the symptoms of leprosy. Altogether, she was painful,
horrible, disgusting, and humiliating to contemplate.</p>

<p>I went back to my ponies to fetch my paint-box. During
my absence there had collected round them half-a-dozen Ainu.
They did not know what to think of the appearance of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
animals, and the few articles fastened to the pack-saddle were
regarded with suspicion. When I appeared on the scene their
astonishment was even greater, and it reached its climax when
I saluted them in the Ainu fashion, and told them that I was
a friend of the Ainu. I unfastened my paint-box and went
back to the old woman. She was still where I had left her.
All the Ainu present followed me, and when I squatted down
they did the same in a semicircle round me. My wretched
model attempted several times to crawl inside the hut, but as
I was sitting close to her, I prevented
her from doing so. There
she sat in the most extraordinary
position, with her head resting on
her left hand, and the stiff fingers
of her right hand pressed on the
ground. One leg was bent up and
the other was folded, resting on the
ground and on the foot of the first.
She was sniffing the wind, and
making efforts to see with her half-blind
eyes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 138px;">
<img src="images/illus-055.jpg" width="138" height="196" alt="MADWOMAN OF YAMMAKKA" title="" />
<span class="caption">MADWOMAN OF YAMMAKKA.</span></div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that
I did not keep my model longer
than was strictly necessary, and
when the sketch was finished I
took her by the arm, brought her back into the hut, and
led her to her favourite corner. There she crouched herself
again, as I had found her; and there I left her, to bear the
miseries of her life, till death, the cure of all woes, shall take
away her soul, if not her body, from the filth she had lived in.
She was neither ill-treated nor taken care of by the villagers
or by her son, who lived in the same hut; but she was regarded
as a worthless object, and treated accordingly. A fish was
occasionally flung to her, as one would to a beast, and in such
a condition this human being had lived, or rather existed,
apparently for several years. Not a word was uttered by
the villagers during the few minutes I took to paint the sketch.
I turned round to inspect my new friends. Others had
come up, and these men and women, hairy and partly naked,
squatting down amidst filth, and driven half mad by the horse-flies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and black-flies, looked just like a large family of restless
monkeys. They were gentle and kind&mdash;much more so than
any of their more civilised brethren; and one of them, a fine
old man, came forward when I came out of the hut and wished
me to go and see a big yellow bear they had captured. I went,
and near the man's hut, in a rough square cage made of
crossed branches of trees, was Bruin grinding his teeth as we
drew near. In a sing-song monotone the man told me the
story of the hunt, and how the bear had been captured. Then
we went from one hut to another all through the village.
Yamakubiro is the name given to the huts taken collectively,
but the man took good care to explain to me that one part of
the village (numbering only seven houses) was called Tchiota,
and the other, a short distance away, was named Yammakka.
Tchiota in the Ainu language means "dead-sand," and Yammakka
is "land in behind."</p>

<p>Yammakka has ten huts. The hut in which I had to put up
was more than filthy, and I had a sort of presentiment that
my landlord was a scoundrel. He saw me giving a small
silver Japanese coin to a girl I had painted. From that
moment I noticed his eyes were continually fixed on my
waistcoat pocket, out of which I had taken the coin. However,
I did not think much of that, as all Ainu are fond of beads,
metals, or anything that shines. When the evening came I
tried to go to sleep on the hard planks, as usual. There is
undoubtedly more <i>board</i> than <i>lodging</i> about Ainu accommodation.
Myriads of Taikkis, the tiny but troublesome and
uninvited guests of all dirty dwellings, did me the honour
to sup off the few drops of blood which remained in my
veins. I owed it to a bottle of Keating's Powder that I was
not carried away bodily by them. I felt cold and feverish, and
having no civilised bed-clothes to cover me, I slept with my
clothes on; and this the more willingly, as I felt an instinctive
mistrust of my host, and I thought it was as well to be ready
for any emergency.</p>

<p>A few salmon were hanging right over my nose. They
hung low, but they smelt high. I had been given a place in
the south-west corner of the hut, and my landlord retired to
the north-east corner. Though this may sound very far, my
host was really not more than a few feet away from me. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
apparently thought that I had gone to sleep, for I heard him
creep to my side. I could not see him, being in absolute
darkness, but though he was evidently holding his breath, I
could feel the warmth of his face near mine. He was listening
to hear if I were asleep. I kept quiet, and pretended to snore.
This gave him courage, and sliding his hand gently along my
arm, he came to a pocket in my coat. He began to explore
it&mdash;but the Ainu are an unfortunate people even when they
try to steal. He had got hold of a pocket with no bottom to
it&mdash;a common occurrence in my coats. The more he explored,
the more he found there was to explore. I am fond myself of
explorations, and I have no objection to a fellow-being, hairy
or not hairy, "prospecting" my empty pockets or my pockets
which have no bottom to them. However, my host was not
satisfied with the first results of his researches, and with his
hand still through the torn lining of the coat-pocket proceeded
to investigate the contents of my waistcoat pockets.
This was a different matter altogether, and catching hold of
him before he was able to disentangle himself, I swung his
arm away and hit him hard on the head with my right fist.</p>

<p>"Wooi!" cried he in despair, and half stunned, as he
scrambled away as best he could to his north-east corner.
By way of apology and excuse, and with a trembling
voice, the man from his corner said that he had only come to
sleep on my side of the hut, as the wind was blowing strong
where he had lain down, and that my side was warmer. A
good excuse indeed when you are caught <i>flagrante delicto</i>
pickpocketing!</p>

<p>The salmon which my host gave me last night for dinner
and this morning for breakfast was so rotten, that, hungry as
I was, I could not eat it. From Yammakka, in a westerly
direction, the way begins with a gentle incline; therefore there
is a complete absence of the high and troublesome reeds which
I had found in the vast marshy plain I had crossed on my
way here from the coast. I intended pushing on to Frishikobets,
a larger village some miles off. The old scoundrel
wanted to accompany me part of the way, saying that there
were two dangerous rivers to cross, and he would show me
where to wade them. I fancied that they were as dangerous
as they were imaginary, and I started off declining his offer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
I came across several Ainu huts on my way, passed the village
of Pensatsunai&mdash;six Ainu huts&mdash;on the Satsunai river, an
affluent of the Tokachi, and then arrived at Obishiro in the
afternoon. There are seven houses at Obishiro. I entered
one of them, and to my astonishment I found myself in
front of an old man and a pretty woman, whose appearance
and manners were as refined as those of the better classes in
Japan. A younger man also came in. Their astonishment
was as great as mine, as they had not seen any civilised beings
since they had been there. Though the outside of their
dwelling was not prepossessing, the inside was so clean that I
felt as if I had dropped into heaven. After what I had gone
through, this unexpected <i>rencontre</i> brought me back to life
and a belief in the proprieties of a civilised existence, almost
forgotten by now!</p>

<p>These people had a romantic history. Watanabe Masaru&mdash;the
younger man&mdash;was a Japanese gentleman by birth and
education, but he had no fortune. Of an adventurous disposition,
clever, sensitive, and tired of the conventionalities of his
fatherland, he decided eight or ten years ago to emigrate to
Hokkaido, and there lead the life of a colonist. The
woman he loved was as brave and constant as he. She
sailed with him and her father from Japan, and after a long
and perilous journey in a junk (sailing boat), they landed at
the mouth of the Tokachi River. In Ainu canoes they went
up the river, and established themselves at Obishiro, far from
civilisation, nearly in the centre of Yezo. At first they had a
great deal of trouble with the natives, but now they are loved
by all. There, with two lovely children, they lead an ideal
life, far from the madding crowd and noise of the world, and
freed from the vulgarity of society.</p>

<p>I rode on to Frishikobets village, situated on the Frishiko,
"old river," and in the midst of a beautiful plain. There are
only twenty-eight houses, and they are scattered about in the
plain at a distance of several hundred yards one from the
other. Some of the huts were hidden in the forest. A peculiarity
of the Ainu of the Upper Tokachi River is, that they
frequently cover their dwellings and storehouses with the bark
of trees, instead of with reeds, as is the custom among the
Ainu of the Saru River and Volcano Bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
I was told here again that Ainu women often suckle small
bears at their breasts so as to fatten them up for the festival;
and one not infrequently sees the women in Ainu households
chewing food, and letting the young cub take it from
their lips.</p>

<p>These Ainu are much more interesting as types, and also
much purer in race, than either the Piratori or the Volcano
Bay Ainu. A learned missionary, who has not himself visited
these people, writes as follows regarding them:&mdash;"The Ainu of
the Tokapchi district, in Yezo, are spoken of as having been
particularly addicted to this kind of warfare (night raids against
each other, in which the men were murdered, and the women
stolen and used as slaves or kept as concubines), and are
even now held in abhorrence by the people of some villages.
They are said not only to have murdered people, but
also to have eaten some of them. They were, therefore,
cannibals, and I have heard them spoken of as 'eaters of
their own kind.'"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>From my own personal experience&mdash;and I may add I am the
only foreigner who has seen these Tokachi, or as others call
them, Tokapchi Ainu&mdash;I came to a conclusion very different
from this. I found that not only were they not cannibals, but
that, taken altogether, they were the most peaceable, gentle,
and kind Ainu I came across during my peregrinations
through the land of the hairy people. Indeed, I am sorry to
say that it is not savagery that makes the Ainu bad, but it is
civilisation that demoralises them. The only place in Yezo
where I was actually ill-treated by Ainu, as my readers will
remember, is the village where they were said to be "very
civilised."</p>

<p>I have no wish to force my opinion on the public as the
correct one. I do but describe what I have actually seen in a
district in which others who have written on this subject have
never set foot, and I leave it to my readers to judge who has
most claim to be heard.</p>

<p>The language of the Tokachi Ainu varies considerably from
the language spoken in more civilised districts, and none of
the natives up the river could speak Japanese when I was
there.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 552px;">
<img src="images/illus-060.png" width="552" height="600" alt="AINU WOMAN OF FRISHIKOBETS, ON THE TOKACHI RIVER." />
<span class="caption">AINU WOMAN OF FRISHIKOBETS, ON THE TOKACHI RIVER.</span></div>

<p>Unfortunately, the Ainu of this region are not very
numerous, and constant intermarriage among near relations
has proved detrimental to the race. However, a glance at
them is quite sufficient to show the difference between them
and Ainu of other tribes. They are not so picturesquely
arrayed as their more western brothers, and the large Japanese
brass and silver earrings, as well as the glass bead necklaces
which make such a brave show yonder, are replaced here by
rough bone or wooden ornaments. Men and women in
summer are almost entirely naked, and all children are clad
in their own bare skins only. Their winter garments are
made of bear and deer skins. Some peculiar snow-sandals,
made of the bark of a kind of ash-tree called <i>shina</i>, are sometimes
worn over the winter salmon-skin boots or moccasins.
The Ainu make their ropes out of the bark of this <i>shina</i>,
though often young vine stems are used for the same purpose.
River fishing-nets are generally made of young vines twisted.
They are of the roughest description, and are only fit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
rivers where fish is abundant, as in the Yezo watercourses.
The Ainu at Frishikobets took very kindly to sitting for their
portraits, and one after the other&mdash;all the best types&mdash;were
immortalised either in oils or in pencil. Strange to say, I
came across another old woman, a lunatic, very similar to the
one I saw at Yammakka. Her face was that of a witch,
her eyebrows joining downwards somewhat in the shape of
an owl's beak. Her long pale hands and face, and the long
wild hair covering half her face, gave her a striking appearance.
She had, however, not yet reached the stage of imbecility
which her Yammakka sister had attained. Lunacy
is very common among the Ainu, and the unfortunate creature
thus afflicted seems to lose not only the respect, but also the
pity, as well as care, of all the others, and is treated by them
as a worthless animal.</p>

<p>After crossing the Frishikobets River, some distance off, on
the east side of the Tokachi River, are the villages of Upar-penai,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
twenty-one Ainu huts, Memuro-puto,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> sixteen huts,
and Ottoinnai,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> fourteen huts. Then comes Kinney, with
seven houses; and finally Nitumap,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the last village on the
Tokachi River, has as many as thirty-six houses.</p>

<p>The huts of the Tokachi region are much smaller than
those on the Saru River, and near many of them is a cage,
in which a big yellow or black bear is confined. The natives
told me that yellow and black bears were numerous in the
neighbourhood. Deer (the <i>yuk</i>, male deer, and <i>mowambe</i>,
female), were formerly plentiful, but now are very scarce.
A few years ago a pestilence killed great numbers of them,
and since then they have dwindled away.</p>

<p>Not many miles from Frishikobets a huge cliff rises perpendicularly
along the Shikarubets River. A landslip seems
to have taken place, which leaves one side of the cliff perfectly
bare and rugged, showing the strata composing the soil.
It is of a light yellowish colour, and it is called by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Ainu the <i>Shikarubets Otchirsh</i>, which translated into English
means "the white cliff on the bend of the river." This cliff
stands very high, and can be seen from a great distance,
especially in a north-east, east, or southerly direction. In
winter, when the rushes and reeds are not so high in the south-eastern
portion of the plain, the white cliff can be distinguished
from the whole of the Tokachi valley. The Ainu themselves
use the Shikarubets Otchirsh as a landmark when out hunting
bears. Owing to its light colour it is visible even at night.
I was anxious to ascend it, as I was sure no European foot
had ever trodden on it before. Accompanied by Watanabe
Masaru, I started out on horseback and crossed the Frishikobets
village and river. Here we left our horses under the
care of an Ainu till our return. We had to cross the Tokachi
in an Ainu "dug-out," and then, proceeding for several miles
in a northerly direction, we arrived at the foot of the mountain.
It would have been impossible to climb it on the east side, as
it is quite perpendicular; but we were fortunate in getting an
Ainu called Unacharo, who said he knew a point from which
we could ascend, and that he would show us the way. He
had been hunting bears on that mountain, and he knew its
slopes well; but as to the way which he was to show us, we
had to make it for ourselves. With our large knives we were
forced to break, cut, and tear the entangled branches of trees
and shrubs before we could get on. We actually had to cut
our way through the dense scrubwood until we reached the
summit. The ascent was rather dangerous in some places,
and extremely rough when going through the brushwood.
We had to keep as much as possible near the edge of the
cliff, for though it involved more danger if we slipped or
stumbled, the entangled shrubs were not so thick on the edge
as farther inland. Finally, after several hours' hard work, we
reached the top, and were well repaid for our fatigues. The
whole of the Tokachi valley was stretched before us as far as
the sea, and almost the whole course of the winding river, with
all its numerous affluents, could be distinguished like so many
shining silver ribbons on the green background formed by the
tall grass and reeds. As a farming region the Tokachi valley
and high plains are certainly the most fertile in Hokkaido.
All the requisites for successful agriculture can be found there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
The absence of the mountain masses of volcanic rocks, so
common all over Hokkaido, the richness of the soil, the
quantity of water for irrigation or for motive power, besides
the comparative facility of making roads on such flat ground,
are qualities that good farmers do not generally despise. It
is therefore a great pity to see all that Tokachi valley
practically deserted and so much good land wasted. Hemp,
wheat, corn, potatoes, beans, and all kinds of vegetables and
cereals, could be grown with advantage, and the produce
carried down the river to the sea without much difficulty and
at little expense. At Yamakubiro the land begins to rise in a
gentle slope, but only to form a plateau, of which the top is
another large plain reaching to the foot of the Oputateishike
mountain mass. The Otopke Mountain is the highest peak,
and resembles in shape the Fujiama of Japan. On the north-east
side of this mountain are the hot springs of Ni-piri-bets.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
A kind of wood is said by the Ainu to be found near these
hot springs which is good for curing wounds, cuts, rheumatism,
and other ailments. These hot springs are not of much
importance, and it is but seldom that even the Ainu themselves
visit them. In going to and returning from these
springs the Shikarubets Otchirsh is never lost sight of by the
Ainu, and by the aid of this landmark they return safely to
their homes.</p>

<p>All the Oputateishike mountain mass is volcanic, and forms
the backbone of the island of Yezo. From the Shikarubets
Otchirsh I was able to draw a bird's-eye view of the course
of the Tokachi River and its affluents, which afterwards
helped me much in delineating a sketch-map of the Tokachi
region, with its complicated watercourses. The two high
mountains of Satsumai and Ghifzan could also be plainly
seen from there. Coming down was much easier than going
up, and when we had again reached the bottom of the
mountain we turned northward until we came to the Shorui-washi
River, an affluent of the Tokachi. Previous to this,
while following the course of the Otsu River, I saw a strange
sight. When on the summit of the Shikarubets Otchirsh I
had seen two Ainu "dug-outs" pass up the river, and the Ainu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
who accompanied us said we should soon see them coming
back again. We were not far from the river banks when
shouts and cries of excitement reached my ears. I hurried on
to the water-side and saw the two "dug-outs" swiftly coming
down with the strong current, parallel with each other at a
distance of about seven feet apart. There were three people
in each "dug-out," viz., a woman with a paddle steering at
the prow; another woman crouched up at the stern, and a
man in the middle. A coarse net made of young vines,
and about five feet square, was fastened to two poles seven
or eight feet long. The man who stood in the centre
of each canoe held one of the poles, to the upper end of
which the net was attached, and attentively watched the
water.</p>

<p>"They are catching salmon&mdash;look!" said Unacharo to me;
"the salmon are coming up the stream from the sea."
The small net was plunged into the water between the two
canoes, and nearly each time a large salmon was scooped out
and flung into one or other of the "dug-outs," where the woman
sitting at the stern crushed its head with a large stone. If a
fish escaped, yells of indignation, especially from the women
folk, broke out from the boats, to be echoed by the high white
cliff. Both men and women were naked, and the dexterity
and speed with which they paddled their canoes down the
stream, working the coarse net at the same time, seldom
missing a fish, was simply marvellous. On the other hand, it
must be remembered that fish were so plentiful in the river,
that it was really easier to catch than to miss. In wading the
Shikarubets (river) I could see large salmon passing me by
the dozen, and I felt quite uncomfortable when some large
fish either rubbed itself against or passed between my legs.
We got across the Shorui-washi&mdash;literally "very burning a
place to stand"&mdash;and having then gone far enough from the
Shikarubets Otchirsh to see the whole of it, I managed to take
a good sketch of it. Near this river are some hot springs,
called Nishibets, from which the river has taken its peculiar
name. The easiest way to the Otopke Mountain is to follow
the valley between the Shikarubets and the Otopke River, and
then climb the mountain on the north-east side. The latter
part of the journey is extremely rough and difficult. Watanabe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and I returned to Obishiro. It is not often that one anywhere
meets with such simple, straightforward people as these
Watanabes. They have lived alone at Obishiro for eight
years among savages, but never in my life have I met with
more civilised, kind, thoughtful, gentle beings than Watanabe
and his wife. As civilisation makes savages bad, I dare say
savage life makes civilised people good! I go away carrying
with me a deep affection for these gentle strangers, whose
kindness to me has made them my friends.</p>

<p>The day came for me to return to the coast. My ponies,
probably frightened by bears, broke loose during the night, and
one of them ran away; and I was rather in a difficulty as to
how I should get back whence I had come. Watanabe, adding
kindness to kindness, allowed me to have one of his ponies,
and after repeated good-byes I started on my journey back to
the coast. About four miles east of Yammakka the Tokachi
River receives a large affluent, the Toshibets, or "river of high
swamps." The Tunnui Puto is the largest of these swamps,
about four miles north of the mouth of the Toshibets. <i>Tunnui</i>
means a kind of tree, probably the <i>Quercus dentata</i>; <i>puto</i> or
<i>put</i> means the mouth of a river. The course of the Toshibets
River is almost from due north to south from its source, then
for about six or seven miles from north-west to south-east,
and, sharply turning again from north to south, continues in
this direction winding continually for eighteen or twenty
miles, till it throws itself with a large body of water in the
Tokachi River. On the southern side of the latter part of the
watercourse are found the Ainu villages of Pombets, twenty-two
huts; Purokenashpa,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> three huts; Kenashpa,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> twelve
huts; and Beppo,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> eleven huts. The characteristics of the
natives of these villages and their habitations are similar to
those already described at Frishikobets. The journey down
was much the same as that coming up. Tobuts, on the north
side of the Tokachi, is the largest Ainu village in the district,
and has as many as sixty huts. The inhabitants are possessed
of a somewhat fiery temper in this particular village, and the day
previous to my going through two men were killed in a row.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
I felt awfully annoyed at being just one day too late to see it,
as then I might have described how the Ainu die. However,
I reached the other side of the Tokachi again. A way through
the same tall rushes and reeds had to be forced, and the same
army of mosquitoes and horse-flies had to be met and endured.
It was my intention to push on and reach the coast as soon as
possible. At Yammakka the natives had seen my runaway
pony galloping at full speed towards the coast, but no one
had caught it. Probably no one had tried.</p>

<p>My ponies went well. I could plainly see where I had
already come through the jungle, by the long trail of crushed
and broken reeds I had left behind me. Everything was
calm, but for the monotonous sound of crashing leaves
produced by my forcing my way through the reeds. Suddenly
my ponies stopped, shied, and began to back. They sniffed
the ground, then the air. Their ears were straight up, their
eyes were restless, and their nostrils widely distended. They
were certainly under some great excitement, and showed
unmistakable signs of terror. "What could be the cause of
it?" I asked myself, but all the same gave the ponies a sound
thrashing to make them go. It was useless&mdash;they would not
stir. The second pony came by the side of mine, and they
both put their heads together, in their own way consulting and
concerting. They were utterly demoralised, and were kicking
awfully. It was getting dark, and this riotous conduct on the
part of my ponies was annoying. Unexpectedly, and with a
tremendous growl, a huge black bear sprang towards us, and
tried to seize the baggage pony. However, he and the beast
I was riding bolted, and ran a desperate race for life; and
though Bruin followed us clumsily for some time, we soon
were far ahead, and lost sight of him. It was more than I
could do to stop the frightened brutes; but finally, after a
reckless steeplechase of many miles, after jumping over
brooks and splashing across torrents, flying over the ground
and through the jungle, without omitting to anathematise a
horsefly that had settled on the back of my neck, and was
amusing itself by boring holes in different parts of it to find a
suitable spot for feeding, finally we came to a halt. It was
about time. During the violent ride the reeds had cut my
face and neck and hands, and I was bleeding all over. I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
on and on, and, as my ponies did not seem to be very tired, I
tried to reach the coast that night. It grew dark, but the
night was fine, and I let the noise of the running river guide
me. Each minute seemed an hour, each hour an age. I rode
and rode, and still rode, till I was nearly exhausted; and still
I was surrounded by the tall reeds and rushes. "Thank
God!" I heartily exclaimed, when finally, at a small hour of
the morning, I found myself in open ground again, and the
wind brought in waves the salt smell of the sea.</p>

<p>An hour or so afterwards two tired ponies were easily
pulled up at the tea-house at Otsu, the landlord was roused,
and a wearied and half-starved traveller was let in.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="small">From the Tokachi River to the Kutcharo River.</span></h2>


<p>I decided to stop a day at Otsu, so as to recover from the
fatigue of my late travels and adventures, and I chose my
quarters in the <i>yadoya</i> of a Japanese called Inomata Yoshitaro.
I was told that he was an ex-convict. Be that as it
may, he had now turned into a fisherman and innkeeper.
Like all Japanese, he was an inexhaustible talker, and his
politeness was so great that it became a bore.</p>

<p>It was about three in the morning when I reached Otsu. I
had taken off my boots on entering his house&mdash;for it is an
insult to enter Japanese houses with one's boots on&mdash;and I
had seated myself on the soft mat in order to rest my aching
limbs, when Yoshitaro made me get up to place a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
square cushion under me, on which he said I should be more
comfortable. I had not been on it one minute before Yoshitaro,
wanting to increase my comforts, made me rise again to
exchange the first cushion covered with cotton for one covered
with silk&mdash;a detail to which a man is not likely to pay much
attention when tired to death, and only anxious to be left
alone. It followed as a matter of course that before I was
allowed to go to sleep I had to sip several cups of tea, which
Yoshitaro's wife had hurriedly made, and I had to relate the
result of my expedition to the sleepy fishermen who had crept
out of their <i>foutangs</i> at the news of my arrival. In spite of
all this, when I had got rid of my audience I had a good
night's rest; but when I woke up the next day at noon I
found myself surrounded by a crowd of fishermen of Otsu,
who had invaded the <i>yadoya</i> to have a peep at the young
foreigner, while in the back yard I recognised the voices of
Yoshitaro and his wife, who evidently were occupied in the
exciting chase of a fowl.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Yoshitaro triumphantly entered the
room with a large dish, on which the same fowl, uncooked, and
cut into a thousand little bits, was served to me, together with
pieces of raw salmon, <i>daikon</i> (a vegetable), and boiled rice.
This he called a European dinner! I did my best to roast
the chicken bits on the <i>hibachi</i> (the brazier); but I was never
well up in the culinary art, and, as my landlord remarked, he
had brought up the meat for me to eat, not to "burn."</p>

<p>Fowls are very scarce indeed in Hokkaido, and the few
found have been imported; therefore the landlord did not
fail to explain, in a roundabout manner, under what great
obligation I was to him for killing such a precious bird.</p>

<p>I said that I had not asked him to do this, and with his
perfect Japanese politeness, bowing gracefully down to the
ground, he said:</p>

<p>"Sayo de gozarimas" ("Yes, your honourable sir").
"But," he added, "the bird was so old that if I had not killed
it I fear it would have died by itself ere long." Such a
sacrifice undoubtedly deserved a reward, and he assured me
that we should be "quite even" if I, being an artist, would
condescend to paint twelve portraits of him. I had no little
trouble to make him understand that he was mistaking me for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
a photographic camera, but I offered to paint him a small
sketch the next morning if he would leave me alone all
that day.</p>

<p>Punctually at sunrise he entered my room. He had his best
clothes on, and his anxiety to be painted was such that he had
not been able to sleep all night. I painted the sketch, and
Yoshitaro and his male and female friends joined in exclamations
of admiration at the good result of the <i>abura è</i> (oil
painting). He professed to be very grateful, and carefully
packed the picture in a box, which he carried into another
room.</p>

<p>I took advantage of his absence to pack up my traps, as I
wished to leave for Shaubets that same morning. In a short
time Yoshitaro came back to my room, but a different man.
He was rude, and tried to bully me. He presented a bill for
the sum of sixteen <i>yen</i>, equivalent to £3 in English money,
which I considered exorbitant for two nights' rest, a few bowls
of rice, and the "European dinner." The highest charge made
by the very best tea-houses in Hokkaido never exceeds one
yen&mdash;two shillings and tenpence a day&mdash;including all meals.
I quietly told the landlord that he was a thief, and that I
would punish him by taking the picture away from him; but
he swore that he would not surrender it, and that he would
fight for it if necessary.</p>

<p>I seldom refuse a challenge when I know that I am going
to get the best of it, and as it so happened that my arms were
a great deal longer than those of Yoshitaro, I caught him by
the throat and shook him so violently that he was nearly
strangled. His friends came to his rescue, and when I
dropped him he fell heavily on the mats, and had to be carried
away. Some minutes elapsed, and while I was hastily taking
my heavier luggage out of the house I heard Yoshitaro in the
next room call out to his wife to bring him a sword, as he
wanted to kill the "<i>ijinsan bakka</i>"&mdash;"the fool of a foreigner."
I entered his room. Yoshitaro, pale with rage, was sitting
by his <i>hibachi</i>, and round him were eight or ten of his men.
They were apparently holding a congress on what to do, and
each one of them, as is usual on all occasions in Japan, had
pulled out his little pipe, and was continually refilling it with
tobacco as they all discussed the matter on hand. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
my boots on this time, as I wished to show the scorn I
had for him, his friends, and his house. In my coat pocket&mdash;the
only sound one&mdash;I had my revolver, but it was not
loaded.</p>

<p>"Yoshitaro," I said, "deliver the picture at once."</p>

<p>"I will not," said he.</p>

<p>"Good!" said his friends in a chorus.</p>

<p>"Yoshitaro," I said again, producing the revolver and
pointing it at him, "if I have not the picture before I count
twenty you will be a dead man."</p>

<p>I never in my life saw a crowd of bullies so scared. Covering
their faces with their hands, Yoshitaro's friends bolted
in all directions, some jumping out of the semi-European window,
some dashing through the violently-opened paper <i>shojis</i>
(sliding doors), leaving eight or ten pipes and as many
tobacco pouches scattered on the mats. The landlord, a
moment ago so brave, had not strength to get up, so great
was his terror. Pale as death, and with a trembling voice,
he called imploringly to his wife, servants, and friends to
come and deliver up the picture.</p>

<p>I had counted up to number fourteen, and no one had put
in an appearance. Then I incidentally mentioned to Yoshitaro
that time was nearly up, and enquired if he preferred to be
shot through the head or the heart, at the same time cocking
my revolver. Yoshitaro shuddered.</p>

<p>At number sixteen a little girl, the only brave one of the
lot, was sent to his help.</p>

<p>"Dutchera Danna?" ("Where is it, sir?") she asked him,
quite perplexed.</p>

<p>"Hatchera, hayaku, hayaku nesan!" ("It is there; quick,
quick, girl!") pointing to a closet in which a pile of <i>foutangs</i>
(small mattresses) were kept rolled during the day.</p>

<p>Yoshitaro had hidden the sketch so well in the closet that
the little <i>nesan</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> could not find it, and when I called out
number nineteen the poor girl, discomfited, cried out, "Mi-imasen"
("I do not see it!")</p>

<p>Yoshitaro was more dead than alive; his lips were white,
and he tried to articulate some words, but could not. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
eyes, fixed on the closet, were glazed and set. His body was
beginning to collapse, and every moment I thought that he
would faint.</p>

<p>In the meantime the <i>nesan</i> hurriedly pulled out all the
<i>foutangs</i> and unrolled them, and the box with the sketch fell
out just as I was about to call out number twenty. She gave
me the box and sketch, and I told Yoshitaro that he must
now come out with me, and, putting my revolver in my
pocket, I pulled the man to the entrance door.</p>

<p>Several villagers had collected at a respectful distance on
the road, waiting for the report of the revolver. Yoshitaro's
wife was the farthest of all.</p>

<p>I signed to them to come nearer, and seeing that the
revolver was no longer in my hands, they came, though very
reluctantly. Yoshitaro was beginning to breathe again; and
when a sufficient crowd had collected, I compelled him to
accuse himself before them all of being a thief, and to confess
that he was glad to have been punished. Also I made him
promise that he would not play such tricks again on any other
traveller.</p>

<p>The Japanese are fond of a good joke, even when it is
played off on one of themselves; and when I had seen all my
baggage safe on my pack-saddles, I gave Yoshitaro the sixteen
dollars he had asked me: "Two dollars," I said, "in settlement
of my bill, and fourteen to go to your doctor for
restoring you to good health after the fright you have had
to-day."</p>

<p>To show how shabby Yoshitaro's nature was, it is enough
to state that out of the sum received his munificence went to
the extent of five <i>sen</i> (2½<i>d.</i>) as a present to the girl who had
come to save his life!</p>

<p>When my ponies were ready, I showed Yoshitaro and his
knavish friends how I had sold them. I brought out my
revolver again, and they all saw that not a single cartridge was
in any of its chambers. This done, I bade them good-bye, and
left them to reflect that it is not always the quietest persons
who can be imposed on with most impunity, but that sometimes
such quiet persons get the best of it, even against ten
bullies or more banded together. I have no doubt that a
good many of my readers will think me cruel for carrying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
joke so far; but, on the other hand, if placed in similar circumstances,
when no redress from without is to be obtained, and
one must defend oneself by main force, very few would treat
such a serious imposition and offence as a joke.</p>

<p>In going through the village more than one fisherman came
to tell me that I had done right in dealing severely with
Yoshitaro, as he was known to be a scoundrel and a thief, and
they all detested him.</p>

<p>There was little of interest between Otsu and Shaubets,
with the exception of the beautiful delta formed in the low
alluvial valley by the Otsu River and the Tokachi River, two
large estuaries nearly two miles apart, by which the Tokachi
River enters the sea. The Tokachi is a river of large volume
and considerable length, and even when divided, the body of
water carried by both outlets is so great as to make it
necessary to cross in boats, fording on foot being quite
impossible.</p>

<p>The Urahoro River was successfully crossed, but for the
twenty miles on to Shahubets the track was flat and sandy,
lying mostly under high clay banks, some of which form
picturesque headlands. The country is not mountainous in
the proximity of the coast, but it is of a moderate elevation
all through, and wooded with deciduous trees. The formation
of the south-east coast from Cape Erimo to Cape Noshafu is
in many ways unlike that of the south-west coast. The
south-western part is more mountainous, and is further
characterised by the absence of extensive plains. The coast-line
is indented, and there is a striking want of broad
beaches. Precipitous rocks are also frequent along the south-west
coast, and thick deposits of pumice&mdash;as we have seen&mdash;are
lying over quaternary rocks, filling up the declivities
of mountain lands and river shores.</p>

<p>In the western part the tertiaries are more tufaceous than
on the south-east coast, and they are distinguished mainly by
the presence of shales and andesite breccia. The south-eastern
part is characterized by the almost entire absence of volcanic
rocks and older eruptive rocks. After leaving the range of
mountains forming the <i>Sparti acque</i>, east and west of Cape
Erimo, high land is met all the way along the south-east coast.
Nevertheless, pumice is found in the basin of the Tokachi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
River, and also in that of the Kushiro River, but it does not
form the surface soil, covering large areas of ground, as in
many places on the south-western portion of the coast.</p>

<p>The different aspect in the tertiaries of the south-east and
south-west coast may be accounted for by the presence of
breccia and conglomerate, shales and sandstones, on the western
part, while on the eastern coast beds of lignite, coal of inferior
quality, and diatom earth form the tertiary strata. If it were
not for the total want of harbours, or even moderately sheltered
anchorages for ships, this south-west portion of Yezo, with its
agricultural resources, its milder climate, and the facilities that
it offers for the construction of roads and railways, ought to
support a large population. As things stand now, there are
no colonists inland, and the coast is deserted and desolate-looking.
As I have mentioned before, the only drawbacks
are the thick fogs prevailing during the summer months along
the south-east coast, and I believe that this in some measure
accounts for the Japanese not wishing to settle in a part of the
country so depressing to their spirits and so trying to their
nerves. I have often noticed how easily affected the Mikado's
subjects are by atmospheric and geographical conditions, and
how, before settling to do business, they make a point of
finding some pleasant spot where to cast anchor, thinking
more of the amenities of physical existence than of the facilities
for successful trade. I did not see a single house for
twenty miles until I reached Shaubets, a village of eleven
Ainu huts and one Japanese house. Thousands of sea-gulls
and penguins lined the sandy shore, and I saw several large
black sea-eagles. A pretty waterfall, gently descending from
the high grey cliff, was decidedly ornamental to the scenery
and useful to the wayfarer, as it afforded my ponies and myself
a good drink of deliciously fresh water. Far off in the distance
I could distinguish a long tongue of land. At Shaubets I was
told that it was the peninsula on which <i>Kossuri</i>, or <i>Kushiro</i>,
as the Japanese call it, is situated. I left Shaubets early in
the morning, with the intention of pushing on to Kushiro,
thirty-one miles distant. At Shiranuka, only ten miles from
Shaubets, I changed my ponies. Shiranuka is an Ainu village,
the inhabitants of which employ themselves in collecting and
drying seaweed. There are also seven or eight Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
shanties besides the Ainu huts. At the mouth of the Tcharo-bets,
near the latter village, coal and lignite of inferior quality
are found; but this coalfield was not worked at the time I
passed through Shiranuka. The remaining twenty-one miles
were monotonous and uninteresting. The long <i>Kossuri</i> peninsula
was before me, increasing in size as I drew nearer; and
after having gone through the two small villages of To'tori
and Akan-gawa, in the neighbourhood of Kossuri, I crossed
the Kutcharo River, on a nicely-built wooden bridge, and
found myself at Kushiro, an important Japanese settlement on
the south-east coast. From its favourable situation Kushiro
is likely to become one of the chief towns in Yezo, though
unfortunately it does not possess a good harbour, and is much
exposed to westerly winds. The largest number of the houses
are situated on a slight elevation above the reef-harbour,
immediately south of the river mouth. In the proximity of
Kushiro, and just beyond the range of hills which stretches for
about three miles from the entrance of the harbour in a
northerly, and for about two miles in an easterly direction, is a
lagoon, called by the Ainu "Harutori." This lagoon is nearly
two miles long, and certainly not more than a quarter of a
mile wide. It is divided from the sea by a very narrow strip
of sand, through which the water of the lagoon finds its outlet.
On the east side of the Harutori coal has been discovered,
and it seems to be of fairly good quality; and three miles
further, quite close to the sea-coast, coal was dug out some
years ago, but the quality was so inferior that the works had
to be abandoned.</p>

<p>There is a considerable area of good land in the neighbourhood
of Kushiro, and here again it is to be regretted that
Japanese farmers do not emigrate to work it. Yezo has a very
small population for its size, and I was surprised that emigration
from the mainland was not carried out on a larger scale.
Yezo is a rich country in many ways. Why do not all the
troublesome students, the fiery <i>soshi</i> of Japan, abandon politics
and futile rows and go and do men's work in that northern
region of the empire? They would profit by it, and so would
their country. An immense loss occurs every year simply
because no one is there to take the profit; and it is a great
pity, and almost a shame, to see so much waste and neglect in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
a region which, after all, is not difficult of access from the main
island of Nippon. To the mineral products of the Kushiro
district must be added the exports of fish (salmon and
herrings), fish manure, and seaweed, which could be greatly
increased if more practical processes were used.</p>

<p>The town of Kushiro itself is not picturesque. There are, I
dare say, as many as five hundred houses, some built in
Japanese, some in semi-foreign style. The streets are very
wide, and along the main street rails have been laid to carry
coal trucks from the Harutori mine down to the shipping
point. Thus the town has a civilised appearance, which was
artistically ugly enough, but refreshing to my eyes after my
experiences along the south-west and south-east coasts. There
are Ainu huts along the river banks, on the high lands, and on
the strip of sand between Lake Harutori and the sea. Unfortunately,
most of the Ainu here, being in the employ of the
Japanese, have adopted Japanese clothes, customs, manners, and
language. Nearly all the younger folks are half-castes. A select
few have even gone so far as to forget their strongest national
characteristic of dirt; and, to my great amazement, one day
I saw an Ainu half-caste actually taking a hot bath. It may
amuse the reader to learn of what this Japanese bathing accommodation
generally consists. It is one of the features in
nearly all fishing stations in Yezo, and it is worth describing.</p>

<p>When the day's work is over, one or more of the iron fish-kettles
or caldrons used for extracting the oil from herrings
are filled with water. These caldrons rest each on a cylindrical
base of stones and clay, thus allowing a big fire of wood
to be lighted under them. When the water has reached a
high temperature, the bather either provides himself with an
old pair of straw sandals (<i>waraji</i>), and steps in, or, placing a
small board on the water, places his foot on it, and forces it
down to the bottom of the caldron by his own weight. He
thus avoids scalding his feet, which otherwise he would do
severely. I have often seen two or three men (Japanese)
placidly sitting up to their necks in the steaming water of the
same caldron, with a huge fire burning under it; and several
times I have been <i>warmly</i> invited by the bathers to join them,
which <i>very warm</i> invitation, however, I invariably <i>coolly</i> considered
and declined with thanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
As regards the Ainu, they are not fond of bathing or washing,
and they share the Chinese idea that it is only dirty
people who need continual washing. They do not regard
themselves as dirty, and therefore dispense with such an
"uncleanly habit."</p>

<p>"You white people must be very dirty," once said an Ainu
to me, as I was taking a plunge into a limpid river, "as you
tell me that you bathe in the river every day."</p>

<p>"And what about yourself?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nishpa," he replied with an air of contempt, "I am
very clean, and have never needed washing!"</p>

<p>If Kushiro is not interesting to an artist, it is decidedly so
from an archæological point of view. Numerous pits, forts, and
camps, flint implements, and fragments of pottery, are found in
the immediate neighbourhood of the town, both on the range of
hills and along the west shore of Lake Harutori. The pits are
found in such numbers as to lead one to believe that the old
"Kossuri" of the Ainu was once the capital of a race of pit-dwellers
previous to the conquest of the whole of Yezo by the
hairy race. The Ainu gave these people the name of <i>Koro-pok-kuru</i>&mdash;men
of the holes. A few words on them may not
be out of place, though, unfortunately, little is to be learned
from the Ainu as to who their predecessors were, and it is
merely by a close examination of their pits, and relics found in
different parts of Yezo and the Kuriles, that we can to a
certain extent trace the existence of such a race of people, and
also prove that they were in no way connected with the
present Ainu.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">The Koro-pok-kuru, or Pit-dwellers.</span></h2>


<p>All over Yezo and the Kurile Islands remains of an extinct
race of pit-dwellers are to be seen. It is especially near lakes
and swamps or along the coast that rectangular, circular, and
elliptical pits are numerous, but square pits are not so common.
None of these pits have yet been discovered on the main island
of Nippon, but many are still to be found as far south as
Hakodate, in Yezo. On the east and north-east side of the
peak, at the latter port, these pits, flint implements, and rude
pottery, mostly in fragments, are met with in great abundance.
The implements consist mostly of arrow-heads, stone adzes,
<span class="figcenter" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/illus-078.png" width="297" height="119" alt="FLINT ARROW-HEADS" />
<span class="caption">FLINT ARROW-HEADS.</span></span>
hammers, flint knives, and round pebbles, which were used as
war ammunition. The arrow-heads vary in size, length, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
breadth. The larger ones I saw measured an inch and three-quarters
in length by an inch and five-eighths in breadth,
while the smaller were seven-eighths of an inch by half
an inch. They were triangular, with the angle at the
point sometimes more, sometimes less acute, or lozenge-shaped;
they are chipped, and not ground. Most of the
arrow-heads and a good many of the knives were made of a
dark reddish siliceous rock. The adzes also, of course, varied
in size and shape, some being oblong in section, others almost
rectangular, while others again were oval. They were ground,
and always made so that the hand could have a good grip on
them. The average length from the sharp edge to the other
end would be about four inches, and the sides were rounded.
It is apparent that most of these adzes were not originally
fastened to a stick or club, but were held in the hand. They
usually have a smooth surface, while the knives, as well as the
arrow-points, exhibit marks of chipping quite plainly; their
edges are very sharp. Hard stones are often found on which
the people of the Stone Age used to grind their implements.
The knives are mostly rectangular, with very sharp edges,
sometimes on both sides. Then there are some in the shape
of a sword-blade, rounded at the top, and with a rounded place
at the other end, where they were held. Those with two sharp
edges were triangular in shape, and were held by the upper
part of the triangle, which point ends with a kind of knob.
<span class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-079.png" width="300" height="140" alt="FLINT KNIVES" />
<span class="caption">FLINT KNIVES.</span></span>
It is a curious fact that bone and bamboo arrow-points&mdash;probably
Ainu&mdash;are sometimes found in pits, and this would
lead me to believe, either that the conquering Ainu used
these weapons in their attacks upon the pit-dwellers, or,
supposing for a moment that the Ainu themselves were the
pit-dwellers in former days, that they had abandoned their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
stone implements and had adopted bone and wood, which
they found easier to work. I am inclined to the first supposition
as the correct one. The pits are numerous in Yezo,
and, following the southern coast from south-west to north-east,
we find that they increase in number towards the north.
Though stone implements and fragments of pottery are
numerous nearly all along the southern coast, but few pits are
found either on Volcano Bay or on the south-west part of the
coast as far as Erimo Cape. As we pass this cape and go
north, on the south-east coast the pits become more numerous,
and at Kushiro&mdash;or Kossuri, as the Ainu call it&mdash;they are found
in great quantities. Further on are some at Akkeshi, and
they are plentiful nearly all along that stretch of the coast as
far as Nemuro, and on Bentenjima, the small island which
forms one side of the harbour at that place. North-east of
that, in the Kuriles, at Kunashiri and Etorofu, we have
abundant evidence that a large population of these pit-dwellers
once existed there. In Etorofu particularly the pits, besides
being frequent, are in much better preservation than any on
the island of Yezo.</p>

<p>The pit-dwellers do not seem to have been particular as to
the shape of their dwellings, though they evidently had a
certain predilection for the elliptical and rectangular forms.
The pits at Kushiro are nearly all rectangular, while those
from Akkeshi to Nemuro are either rectangular or circular.</p>

<p>The average dimensions of rectangular pits are about twelve
feet by nine feet, but I have seen some as large as sixteen feet
by twelve feet. The sides slope inwards, and the average
depth is from three to six feet. Pits which are situated on
cliffs, or at any height, are generally deeper, probably for the
extra shelter required by those living at an altitude, compared
with those living on the sea-level. The round pits are from
ten to fourteen feet in diameter, and the elliptical have a
length of about sixteen feet, and are about eight feet at the
widest part of the ellipse. The pits which I found on the
north-east coast of Yezo, from Shari to Cape Soya, were not so
numerous as those on the southern coast; but some of them
were larger in size, as probably, owing to the greater severity
of the climate, more people lived in the same hut for the
purpose of creating natural heat. At Tobuts, on the Saruma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Lake, are three of elliptical shape. Near Abashiri several
well-preserved specimens of pottery have been found, especially
in the mud of swamps or lakes; but after leaving Lake
Saruma, I did not see any traces of the pit-dwellers till I
approached Soya Cape. When these pits are excavated, a
stratum of sand is generally found, and beneath it a large
quantity of charcoal in the centre of the pit. Under the
charcoal the earth is burnt, showing that the hearth was in the
centre of the dwelling, as it is now in the Ainu huts. This
goes to prove that there was one fire, and not, as some
travellers have endeavoured to show, five or six burning at
the same time, round which, or, rather, between which, the
pit-dwellers slept. I have often dug in different parts of pits,
and have invariably come upon this burnt charcoal in or near
the middle. I never saw any signs of more than one fire in
the same pit. Digging in a large pit at Kushiro, I found some
stag-horns, and numerous bits of black and red pottery. Some
of the fragments had rough line ornamentations on them.
There was also a large quantity of war ammunition, in the
shape of big pebbles and round stones. Most pits contain
heaps of rubbish and bones of animals. Sometimes there are
heaps of oyster shells, as near the pits on Saruma Lake; and
these shell-heaps are similar to those found on the main island
of Nippon. In another pit on one of the forts at Kushiro
I found what I thought was part of a human skull; but
on a closer examination it turned out to be the skull of an
animal&mdash;probably a fox or a stag. A bone arrow-point also
came to light in the same pit, and several stone defensive
weapons. It was interesting to note that this pit was built on
the top of a small conical hill, and that the hill itself was
surrounded by a ditch only a few feet wide, thus forming a
kind of fort. On the side and at the bottom of the fort I saw
numbers of stones, which had in all probability been used by
the pit-dwellers as missiles against the attacking Ainu during
a battle. Besides forts, the pit-dwellers had camps, generally
situated in a commanding position above a river, a
lake, or a harbour. Single pits also are found only under
similar conditions.</p>

<p>Near Kushiro, on the Lake Harutori, which is divided from
the sea by a sand isthmus, are several camps and one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
forts, the first of which overlooks the sea. Along the
Kutcharo River are forts and camps. These camps are on the
crowns of the hills, and each is surrounded by a small ditch.
In the last, about three miles from the coast, were several
square pits, larger than those on the other three forts. This
last fort stands some distance back from the river, and is
situated in a little plain at the summit of a detached mound,
which has the appearance of having been artificially cut from
the larger remaining portion of the hill itself. The shape of
the fort is a broken cone, and the base measures about nine
hundred feet in circumference, while the upper one is about
three hundred. From the top, where there is only a small
pit, the entrance of the river can easily be watched; and it
must have been almost impregnable, as the walls of the fort, or,
rather, the sides of the conical hill, rise nearly perpendicularly
from the plain. A small stream runs at the foot of the fort.</p>

<p>On the Lake Harutori the range of hills which stretches
from the sea for three or four miles along its eastern shores is
literally covered with these pits, and on the sandy isthmus
separating the sea from the lake some very large pits can be
observed. The fort near the sea is called <i>Shirito</i> by the
Ainu, and that at the other end of the range goes by the
name of <i>Moshiriya</i>. It was in the latter fort that the well-shaped
bone arrow-point was found, as well as one or two
stone adzes, which were so shaped as to fit the hand, and
evidently had been used as hammers, or weapons of offence at
close quarters. In the same fort I found two stags' horns in
good preservation, and many bones of different animals. It
is doubtful whether these heaps of horns and bones were
brought into the pits for the purpose of making arrow-points
and other weapons, or whether the stags had been used merely
for food. The bone arrow-point found in the same pit was
not in such a decayed condition as most of the bones I found
there, which led me to believe that it was not made out of the
same kind of bone, or that the bone out of which it was made
had been cured before its conversion into an arrow-point. I
believe that in the neighbourhood of Kusuri&mdash;or Kushiro, as it
is now called by the Japanese&mdash;there are as many as a thousand
or fifteen hundred pits. In Etorofu, at Bet-to-bu, on the
north-west coast of the island, nearly as many are to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
along the seashore, mostly on the plain at the top of the cliffs
overlooking the sea, while the rest are situated on the banks
of a narrow stream and along what appears to have been a
river course. On the same island, at Ru-pets, are several pits
of a similar description, and a fort.</p>

<p>As the pit-dwellers have disappeared from Yezo and the
Kuriles, and only pre-historic remains and relics have been
left behind to indicate their former existence, the questions
naturally arise: Who were these pit-dwellers? Whence did
they come? and whither have they gone? We can place no
reliance on the accounts given by the Ainu or by the highly
imaginative Japanese, who, moreover, are perfectly ignorant on
this subject. Some Ainu say that Yezo was formerly peopled
by a race of dwarfs, who were their enemies, and were extirpated
by them after many sanguinary battles. The Ainu are
very vague as to when and where these battles were fought, but
according to their accounts these pit-dwellers, whom they call
the <i>Koro-pok-kuru</i>&mdash;literally "men of holes"&mdash;once inhabited
Yezo and the Kuriles. They were only three or four feet in
height, and some semi-Ainu stories represent them as being
only a few inches tall. This of course might be taken to mean
that they were very small by comparison. A few Ainu, yet
more imaginative than others, go so far as to say gravely that
the Koro-pok-kuru were so tiny that when a shower of rain
came they hid under burdock leaves for shelter. Others,
however, tell us that these Koro-pok-kuru were their ancestors,
and much more hairy than the Ainu of the present day. They
were strong, fond of hunting, and able to cross the mountains
with great facility and speed. According to Mr. Batchelor,
some Ainu state that they themselves formerly lived in huts
over pits, and that they changed their method of house-building
on coming in contact with the Japanese; but if this
were the case it seems unaccountable that they should distinguish
their predecessors as pit-dwellers. Moreover, if the
influence of the Japanese was sufficiently strong to cause them
to make this most important change in their habitations and
mode of living, how comes it that in other matters they have
not adopted Japanese customs? I was unable to trace the
slightest resemblance between Ainu huts and Japanese edifices
of any kind, either in their general appearance or in any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the smaller details, and I was always struck by the small
extent to which the Ainu have adopted the customs of the
dominant race. Indeed, the character of Ainu buildings is
peculiar to the Ainu themselves, and, far from constructing
their dwellings over pits, they go to the other extreme, and
perch their storehouses on piles or posts. It is a remarkable
coincidence that on the Lake Kutcharo, not many miles from
Kusuri, where the Koro-pok-kuru pits are numerous, the roofs
of the Ainu huts and storehouses are not angular, but circular,
which gives them the appearance of half a cylinder resting on
the ground. This struck me as being in all probability the
shape of structures built over rectangular pits, while the
coverings of round pits must have been shaped like half a
sphere, similar to the snow houses of the Esquimaux, and the
elliptical like the longer half of an egg.</p>

<p>The present houses of the Kutcharo Lake Ainu, however,
are not built on pits; and on my questioning the few inhabitants
of the village, all were perfectly ignorant of the existence
of the Koro-pok-kuru, and they knew nothing of their own
ancestors, nor whether they had built structures over pits or
not. The idea seemed to them highly ludicrous, and afforded
them a great deal of amusement.</p>

<p>On the north-east coast of Yezo, where pits are found, some
Ainu huts have round and others angular roofs; but even in
the latter instance, the angle of the two sides of the roof is not
as acute as with the huts on the Saru and the Tokachi River;
but both slant in a more gentle way, forming an obtuse angle
of about 135°. In fact, these variations in the Ainu architecture
have not yet been accounted for, and whether they
copied their roofs from their foes the Koro-pok-kuru, or
whether it is a mere chance that the roofs bear a certain
resemblance, cannot be discovered from tradition or hearsay.
I may mention incidentally my own theory, which may afford
an explanation of this point. As the Saru, the Tokachi,
and the Ishikari districts have no very severe weather in
winter, and only a comparatively small quantity of snow falls
during the colder months, the Ainu build huts with very
slanting roofs, so that the snow should not remain on them
in winter, while during the summer months the rain should
fall off the steep incline of the roof before it could filter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
through into the hut. On the Kutcharo Lake and on the
north-east coast, where strong winds are prevalent, the huts
have round roofs, so as to offer the least possible resistance to
the gales, and thus escape the danger of being blown down.</p>

<p>With regard to the snow, the opposite of the Saru Ainu
method is practised. Instead of preventing the snow from
resting on their roofs, the Ainu of the colder regions do all they
can to let it remain, for by thus forming an air-tight vault it
renders the hut much warmer in winter. In other words, the
system is the same as that adopted by the Esquimaux, with
the exception that the latter, I believe, have no frame to their
huts, and the vault is entirely of snow and ice; while with the
Ainu of the north-east coast the snow vault is directly over the
hut itself. I invariably noticed on the north-east coast, where
the Ainu have a mixed architecture, that wherever a hut was
built in an exposed position it had a round roof, while those
built under the shelter of a cliff or a hill had angular ones, and
this is what led me to the above conclusion.</p>

<p>To return to the Koro-pok-kuru, they undoubtedly must
have had semi-spherical and semi-cylindrical roofs over their
pits, whether the vault was constructed of mud, sticks, and
reeds, or simply of snow and ice, like the Esquimaux dwellings.
For all that we know, the Koro-pok-kuru huts may have had
conical roofs, like those of the present American Indians; but
one fact is certain, that whatever shape the roof may have had,
it was not supported by a central pole, for the hearth is invariably
in the centre of the pit.</p>

<p>The curious fact already mentioned, that in every pit we
find a thick layer of sand, seems to prove that it was certainly
intended to render the ground less damp; and it is my own
impression that these pit-dwellers, having snow or ice vaults
over their heads, resorted to that expedient to keep the floor
of their huts dry under the continuous dripping of the vault,
melted by the heat of the fire inside. Undoubtedly Yezo was
a much colder country in bygone years than it is now; and
though we cannot implicitly rely on the information given by
the Ainu, they are all of one opinion in believing that their
country was all ice and snow in former days, and to give a
proof of it they say: "Why should we be as hairy as a bear if
not to keep the cold out?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
The Japanese know the pit-dwellers by the name of "Ko-bito,"
or "Ko-shto," the latter word meaning "men of the
lakes,"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but they know nothing of their history.</p>

<p>One fact still remains to be explained, namely, who made
the pottery that is disinterred in almost every pit and by the
shores of lakes. The present Ainu do not know how to make
pottery, and they have never been known to manufacture anything
of the kind. All Ainu implements are made of wood,
though of course the more civilised tribes have now purchased
iron or porcelain implements from the Japanese. The question,
then, is, supposing that the Ainu were formerly the pit-dwellers,
have they lost the art of making pottery, or did the
pottery belong to a different race of people?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-086.png" width="400" height="184" alt="KORO-POK-KURU POTTERY AND FRAGMENTS OF DESIGNS" />
<span class="caption">KORO-POK-KURU POTTERY AND FRAGMENTS OF DESIGNS.</span></div>

<p>It seemed singular to me that, conservative as the Ainu are
of their relics, even allowing for its brittle nature, no pottery of
the kind found in pits is ever to be seen in any Ainu hut.
Had they made the pottery themselves, surely some specimens
or parts of specimens would have been preserved.</p>

<p>Comparing facts, we find, then, that the Koro-pok-kuru built
their huts over pits, made pottery, and used stone and flint
implements; while the Ainu have never been known to dwell
in pits, have never made pottery, and have always used bone
or bamboo implements. Moreover, Ainu traditions of internecine
wars, vague as they are, and their designating the
enemy by the name of Koro-pok-kuru, are further proofs that
the Ainu themselves do not regard the pit-dwellers as their
forefathers. As, then, the few facts collected tend to prove that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the Ainu and the Koro-pok-kuru were two distinct races,
it would be interesting to know who the latter really were, and
what became of them. A learned missionary, Mr. Batchelor,
writing on this subject, says:&mdash;"But I am of opinion that
these pit-dwellers were closely allied to the Ainu in descent,
and that the remains of them may now be seen in Shikotan
and other islands of the Kurile Group. The inhabitants of
Shikotan are much shorter in stature than the Ainu of Yezo.
They are not so good-looking, and are said to be a very
improvident race. The Ainu look upon the Kurile Islanders
as the remnants of the Koro-pok-gurus; but this is a mere
opinion, to be adopted or rejected at pleasure. That they
are pit-dwellers <i>is quite certain</i>, for <i>they live in pits</i> at the
present day."</p>

<p>Before being so certain as to what he was stating, it would
have been well had the writer of the above lines visited the
island in question. He would not then have committed so
many blunders in so few lines. The inhabitants of Shikotan
are <i>not</i> shorter than the Ainu of Yezo, and I cannot give
a better proof of this than by asking my readers to compare
the measurements which I took while there with the measurements
of the Yezo Ainu. The medium height of the
Shikotan Ainu is between sixty-one inches and sixty-two
and three-quarter inches; the medium height of the Yezo
Ainu is between sixty-one inches and sixty-two and three-quarters,
or exactly the same. The chest inflated measures
thirty-seven and a half inches with the Shikotan Ainu, and
thirty-seven and a half with the Yezo Ainu, while the spinal
column is only twenty-four inches with the Shikotan Ainu,
and about twenty-six and three-quarters with the Yezo Ainu.</p>

<p>The Shikotan Ainu have the same structural peculiarity as
the Yezo Ainu, namely, the length of their arms, which
peculiarity, by the way, is greatly accentuated with them.
The humerus is much longer than with the Yezo Ainu, while
the ulna and radius are shorter; the hand is the same length.
A Shikotan Ainu with outstretched arms is generally the
length of one hand longer than his own height, which is more
than is usually found with the Yezo Ainu. The medium foot
is nine and a half inches with both Ainu. In the Ainu the
tibia is rather flattened at its angular part, but the Shikotan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Ainu have a nearly circular tibia. I do not know of any other
existing race in the world in which such an extraordinary
phenomenon occurs, and the tibia struck me also as being
extremely long, while the femur appeared proportionately
short. However, with the exception that the tibia is more
circular than with the Ainu of Yezo, I could not see any
material difference between them and the other Ainu. As we
have already seen, each tribe in Yezo has certain characteristics
which other tribes have not; each tribe has conformed its
habits to the climate of the district in which it lives, as well as
to other circumstances; and each of these tribes has adopted a
slightly different architecture for its dwellings; but it is plain
that all belong to the same original race. The same might be
said of the Shikotan Ainu. At this point it is well to explain
that the Kurile Islands not many years ago belonged to
Russia; but they were exchanged for the southern half of
Sakhalin, then belonging to Japan, and now form part of the
Japanese Empire. The two larger islands&mdash;Kunashiri and
Etorofu&mdash;are inhabited mainly by Ainu and a few Japanese,
who migrate there from Yezo during the fishing season; while
the Island of Shikotan is inhabited by sixty Ainu, brought
there from the northern islands of Shirajima or Shimushir, and
Urup, leaving thus all the islands north-east of Etorofu
uninhabited.</p>

<p>Of Kunashiri and Etorofu I shall say no more in connection
with the pit-dwellers, but a few more words on the Shikotan
inhabitants may prove interesting, especially as people have
been led to believe that they are the descendants of the Koro-pok-kuru,
and not really Ainu.</p>

<p>I shall begin by saying that the Shikotan people call themselves
Kurilsky <i>Ainu</i>, and that they speak both Ainu and
Russian. Their features are not very massive, and their cheek
and temple bones slightly project. They have strong mouths,
and eyes identical in shape and colour with those of the Yezo
Ainu. They are as hairy; they live by fishing and hunting;
they clothe themselves in skins; and they are fond of beads
and shining ornaments. Their huts have angular roofs, and
are built in the same style as those of the Yezo Ainu, but on a
smaller scale. The interiors are also alike, and equally dirty,
if not more so. The Ainu huts at Shikotan are sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in number, and <i>not one</i> of them is built over a pit, thus showing
that Mr. Batchelor was a little rash, when, relying on mistaken
information, he drew a conclusion which is not in accordance
with the facts. One thing that has misled most people as
regards these Kurilsky Ainu is, that they were compelled to
cut their hair and shave their beards. To the superficial
observer this naturally gives them a different physiognomy
from that of the Yezo Ainu, who let their hair grow long, and
have flowing beards. Prof. Milne, who some years ago visited
the Island of Shumshu,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> relates that he saw there a small group
of Kurilsky Ainu, who, all included, numbered twenty-two.
Their dress, although made of skins, was European in form,
and the upper garment, shaped like a shirt, was made of bird-skins
(puffins) with the feathers inside. The back was ornamented
with the plumes of the yellow puffin, and the edge
was trimmed with seal-fur. The men wore garments tied at
the waist with a belt of sea-lion hide. Their feet and legs up
to the knee were covered with moccasins, also made of sea-lion
skin, and their food consisted of a few berries, the eggs
and flesh of sea-birds, seals, and other meat. They were few
and migratory, and carried with them all their property when
migrating. Prof. Milne, in a paper contributed to the Asiatic
Society of Japan, thinks that the chief point in connection with
these people is, that they constructed houses by making
shallow excavations in the ground, which were then roofed
over with turf, and that these excavations had a striking
resemblance to the pits now found further south. I believe,
however, that Prof. Milne never saw them excavating
these pits, and the fact that hardly two dozen people in the
extreme north-east Kuriles having temporarily adopted shallow
excavations which they roofed over, is barely sufficient proof
that they were pit-dwellers, and, as will be seen later, I had
ample evidence afterwards that they were not. It is probable
that this wandering band, owing to the scarcity or difficulty of
procuring timber in those regions&mdash;the smallness of their
canoes not permitting them to transport the materials for
above-ground structures from one island to another&mdash;it is
probable, I say, that, having come upon pits already dug, they
had roofed them over and lived in them, finding them suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to the severe climate. When I visited Shikotan (September,
1890), where not only these Shimushir people, but all the
Kurilsky Ainu, numbering sixty, are now collected, and where
they have built dwellings in their own style, the architecture
and mode of construction were identical with those of the Yezo
Ainu, and there were <i>no</i> pits whatever to their huts.</p>

<p>Had they been pit-dwellers, why should they have so
suddenly modified their habits as to construct huts wholly
above-ground without any reason for so doing? Supposing
they were actually pit-dwellers, and had lived generation
after generation in pits, why should they abandon this chief
structural characteristic in a place where the climate is as
severe as in the islands they formerly inhabited? I am willing
to admit that the Kurilsky Ainu, like all barbarians, made the
best of what they found in their migrations from one island to
another, and that, having found pits already dug, they had
lived in them simply for convenience, and to protect themselves
from the cold. The impossibility of constructing their own
style of dwellings, which would have required too much time
and a great amount of timber and reeds&mdash;two articles scarce in
the north-east Kuriles&mdash;may account for their being driven to
occupy pits already dug; but I am certainly not inclined to
admit that therefore the few remaining Kurilsky Ainu are in
any way connected with or related to the Koro-pok-kuru. I
believe that I have given sufficient evidence to prove this. At
any rate, I have given such evidence as it was in my power to
collect, and I have based my statements on what I actually
saw, and not on what I heard people say. As others have
speculated on this subject, I shall now ask the forgiveness of
the reader if I am also dragged into a little pre-historic speculation
as to who the Koro-pok-kuru were, and whence they
came.</p>

<p>As I remarked at the beginning of this chapter, we find
that pits are more numerous as we go in a north-east direction.
Thus, few are found at Hakodate; and though none or few
have been found along the south-west coast of Yezo, still, flint
arrow-heads, pottery, and stone adzes collected here and there,
show us that the Koro-pok-kuru had travelled along that
coast, probably journeying in their canoes, landing to hunt, or
to fight the Ainu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Along the south-east coast the pits increase in number as
we approach Kusuri, and at this place the largest number of
pits in Hokkaido is found; then they are numerous all along
the coast as far as Nemuro; and in the islands of Kunashiri
and Etorofu the population must have been large, as there
are numerous pits throughout. Pits are found in the smaller
islands of the Kurile group, and I believe also in Kamschatka.
From Nemuro, following the coast-line of Yezo, we find some
along the north-east coast of Yezo, and none down the west
coast until we reach the narrower part of the island near
Sappro. This said, we have two points to consider:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) That the pit-dwellers moved from north-east to south-west.</p>

<p>(2.) That the main bulk of the population settled in Etorofu,
Kunashiri, and at Kushiro. Few went further south to settle.</p>

<p>All evidence tends to show that they came either from
Kamschatka, or perhaps more probably from the Aleutian
Islands. It seems not improbable, looking at the volcanic
formation of the Kurile group, that in bygone days Yezo was
joined to Kamschatka, affording a land passage to the migratory
people; but this we need not take into consideration.</p>

<p>From what one can gather of this race, the habits and
customs of the Koro-pok-kuru must have had many points in
common with the present Esquimaux. Very likely their pits
were roofed over with a snow vault. They evidently lived by
fishing and hunting, like the Esquimaux, and all that we know
identifies them more with the latter race than with the Ainu.</p>

<p>I believe that the present Aleuts have a striking resemblance
to the Esquimaux; and if this were the case, there is no reason
why we should not suppose that they in former days inhabited
the Kuriles, part of Kamschatka and the north-east portion of
Yezo. It is a well-known fact that the Esquimaux formerly
lived in corresponding latitudes on the east coast of America,
and that they withdrew little by little to the more inhospitable
regions of the north, and the same might have occurred here
after the Ainu invasion of Yezo. The Koro-pok-kuru were
apparently more civilised than their conquerors the Ainu, for
they made pottery and worked stone; but owing to their
retiring nature and weaker physique, and outnumbered by the
savage hairy people, they became extinct. As to the Ainu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
they also are undoubtedly a race of the north. Their music,
their decorations, their habits, display characteristics of
northern origin; but the Ainu, as we have seen from their
structures and customs, were by no means accustomed to so
cold a climate as their predecessors the pit-dwellers. In my
opinion they did not invade Yezo from the Kuriles, but came
from the continent of Asia, probably across Siberia, and
descended as far as Sakhalin Island, where many Ainu are
still to be found. As the Koro-pok-kuru resemble the
Esquimaux, the Ainu have a striking resemblance in many
ways to the Northmen of Europe, and this is what makes me
suppose that they came across the northern part of the
continent, and not from the northern islands of the Pacific.
They made their way south, probably crossing over the La
Perouse Strait, and the main contingent of them came down
the north-east coast of Yezo. I base this theory on the fact
that the strong current which passes through the La Perouse
Strait from west to east would have made it impossible for the
Ainu in their light "dug-outs" to navigate against it, or straight
across from Sakhalin to Soya Cape, and in crossing they were
undoubtedly drifted far south-east on the north-east coast,
probably landing near Abashiri or Shari. Another evidence
which made me think that the Ainu came from Sakhalin is,
that all knew of another island besides Yezo, which they
called Krafto, by which name they designate Sakhalin. Of
the Kuriles no one knew except those in the immediate
neighbourhood. At one time the Ainu are said to have
inhabited the whole of Japan as far south as Satsuma.
Archæologists are puzzled by the discovery in the main island
of Nippon of various kitchen-middens, which include fragments
of pottery identical with those attributed to the Koro-pok-kuru,
and also of shell heaps, which some consider of Ainu
origin, others as pre-Ainu. No pits, however, have been
found near these shell heaps, nor on any part of Nippon.
Thus another question is raised as to who the originators of
these shell heaps and kitchen-middens were. Is it not likely
that, as the Ainu proceeded south, they encountered the
Koro-pok-kuru at Nemuro and then at Kushiro, and, having
easily defeated them, forced some of them to retreat in the
direction of the Kuriles, while the rest went towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
south? They probably fled along the coastline in their "dug-outs,"
those who moved south occasionally landing to hunt
or to attack their pursuers. Thus we can account for the
occurrence along that coast of some of their implements, but
of no pits, which they were not likely to dig in such circumstances.
Having then retreated as far south as Ushongosh
(Hakodate), and with the conquering Ainu still at their heels,
there was nothing more natural than that they should cross
the Tsugaru Strait,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> only a few miles in width, carrying with
them their kitchen-middens and pottery.</p>

<p>The Ainu crossed after them, and, pushing the retreating
Koro-pok-kuru further and further south, exterminated them,
and became the masters of the whole of Japan, the Kuriles,
and Sakhalin. As they were thus pursued by the Ainu, whom
they knew as a warlike people, and stronger than themselves,
there seems to me no cause for wonder that the Koro-pok-kuru
did not dig any pits while on the main island of Nippon,
first, because these pits would have been the sure means of
bringing the Ainu on their track, to their certain annihilation;
next, because the climate, being a great deal warmer, they had
no need for them. On the other hand, it is more than
probable that the retreaters carried with them their kitchen-middens
and pottery, which constituted their treasures, and
without which they could not have prepared their food. The
barbarous Ainu then came in contact with the Japanese, at
whose hands they received the same treatment as that which
they had inflicted on the Koro-pok-kuru. Little by little the
land so easily conquered was lost again, and the conquering
Ainu were ere long in retreat towards the north. They were
beaten and defeated by the more civilised Japanese, and the
few who survived had to cross over the Tsugaru Strait back to
Yezo. There is not a single Ainu now to be found in Nippon,
with the exception of a child, a half-caste, whose mother was
an Ainu, and who lives about sixty miles south of Awomori.
The mother of this child was the last of her race who was born
on and who inhabited the main island of Nippon.</p>

<p>Ainu blood can be traced in many of the Japanese in the
northern part of Nippon, especially between Shiranoka to Awomori,
and also some corrupted Ainu words are still in use in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the dialect spoken in that part of Japan. Names of places,
rivers, towns, etc., of Ainu origin, are common all over Japan.
It was this former occupation of Japan by the Ainu that
for some time led people to believe that the Ainu were the
forefathers of the Japanese; and when pits were found in Yezo,
the same hastily-judging people attributed them to the Ainu;
and then, when mention was made of the Koro-pok-kuru and
the Ko-shto, they affixed this name to the Kurilsky Ainu
whom they had never seen nor studied.</p>

<p>I am not prepared to say whether or not traces of these
Koro-pok-kuru are to be found in the Aleutian Islands, as
I have not visited them; but it would prove interesting to
trace a connection between them and some existing race, in
case my supposition be not correct, though I am sure that it is
nearer the mark than any of the conjectures made by others
with regard either to the Ainu or the Koro-pok-kuru. At any
rate, as I do not pretend to infallibility; should my supposition
be wrong, the facts given above will remain, and a more
successful student and investigator will be able to work on
them with a decided advantage over the writer, who had
to start from the very beginning, and work on information
which was more of an obstacle than a help.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="small">The Kutcharo River and Lake&mdash;A Sulphur Mine&mdash;Akkeshi and its Bay.</span></h2>


<p>The Kutcharo River is of some importance, for though not of
great length, it is navigable by small boats for nearly twenty
miles from its mouth.</p>

<p>I left Kushiro one morning, and made my way up the river,
not by boat but along its banks on horseback, so as to get a
better idea of the surrounding country and its inhabitants. At
Kushiro I left more than half my luggage, to be sent down to
Hakodate by the first ship that happened to call, and this
greatly changed my mode of travelling. Instead of two ponies,
one pony would now be quite sufficient to carry my baggage
and myself; and where ponies were not obtainable, I could
carry all my paraphernalia on my own back with no very
great difficulty, and in this way I should not be hindered on
my journey.</p>

<p>I daresay the baggage I was carrying now weighed about
forty-five pounds. It mostly consisted of painting materials,
and wooden panels, on which I usually paint my sketches when
travelling.</p>

<p>As to clothes and boots, I was beginning to be rather "hard
up." No weaver's work, no tailor's garments, nor tanner's
hides, can stand the wear and tear of such rough travelling as
I had had, and the old saying, that a "light heart and a thin
pair of breeches carry you a long way," is most decidedly not
to be applied to anyone journeying to and fro on a pack-saddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
in Yezo. My coat and trousers were showing signs of rapid
decay, and I thought with vain desire of needle and thread,
buttons and hooks. My boots were falling to pieces owing to
their continual immersion in salt water. The impossibility of
cleaning or greasing them added to the original damage; and,
worse luck of all, they could not be replaced. Altogether,
what with frayed garments, leaky boots, a battered hat, and a
general out-at-elbows air, I was scarcely presentable in any
society a grade above that of the hairy Ainu.</p>

<p>A road has been cut between Kushiro and Shibetcha, a
distance of thirty miles; but though quite new, it is already out
of repair, and it will not be long before it is washed away
entirely. The Japanese Government does its best to open
roads near the largest settlements, but Japanese officials do
not seem to understand that after a road has been made it has
to be kept in repair.</p>

<p>The country all along is good, and the soil seems rich and
fertile. Nearly half-way up, on the east side of the Kutcharo
River, are three lakes,&mdash;the Takkobe, the Tori Lake, and the
Shirin. The Tori is the largest. Its length is five miles, its
width about one mile. On the southern shore of this lake is a
picturesque Ainu village, with its old tumble-down huts, and
close to it is a group of Japanese houses. The contrast
between the dirty and neglected old hovels of the Ainu and
the clean, spruce, and somewhat finikin houses of the Japanese
is very striking. In this difference we read an epitome of the
way in which civilisation has travelled from primitive barbarism.
The road runs through dense forests; but in several places,
especially on its highest level, we come to lovely views of
mountain scenery, towering over the shimmering water of the
underlying lakes.</p>

<p>In the evening I reached Shibetcha, a nice little place, constructed
on each side of a large road which rises considerably
as it goes through the village. The village lies in a small
valley surrounded by moderately high mountains, and is on the
western side of the Kutcharo River, which intersects the valley.
A wooden bridge and a three-storied Japanese tea-house are
the two main structures in the place. There are sixty-eight
houses in the village, and nearly half of them are houses of
ill-fame, the three-storied tea-house being the principal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
At a distance of twenty-five miles from here is a sulphur
mine, and the miners, after having amassed sufficient money,
come and squander it at Shibetcha, thus supporting this nook
of demoralization in the wilderness of these mountains. As
the river becomes very shallow, the mineral from the sulphur
mine of Yuzan was carried until quite recently on pack-saddles
as far as here, whence it was brought down by boat to
Kushiro for shipment; but a small railway, on which only a
"truck train" is now running once a day from the mine to
Shibetcha, has greatly simplified matters, and increased the
export returns of the mine.</p>

<p>By the kind permission of the Mitsui Company I was
allowed to travel on one of the trucks (no passenger carriages
being provided), and the two and a half hours' journey was
thus accomplished much more comfortably than if I had
ridden the twenty-five miles on my pack-saddle. The railway
took me to the foot of Mount Yuzan, and that same afternoon
I made the ascent of the mountain. The most valuable
sulphur deposits in Japan are found on this mountain, the
quantity of the mineral being practically unlimited. The
ascent was hard work, but it was interesting to see the
<i>fumaroles</i>, whence the sulphur is extracted, and whence a
dense smoke shoots out with great force. The whole
mountain is covered with thick layers of sulphur of very
good quality, and when more practical processes are employed
for the extraction and carriage of the mineral there is no doubt
that the sulphur trade will assume a very prominent place in
the exports of Yezo. Dozens of men are employed now to
carry the sulphur from the mountain to the railway, but there
is work enough for hundreds and hundreds more. All the
sulphur is at present carried on small wheelbarrows, which
each man slings on to his shoulders when empty and he is
going up the mountain. When the sulphur is reached the
workman sits down, pulls out his pipe, which he fills from the
folds of his tobacco-pouch, has a quiet smoke and a good rest,
then he slowly fills his wheelbarrow with the primrose-yellow
blocks, and comfortably wheels it down hill to the station, a
considerable distance. Such a primitive fashion of carriage
involves great loss of time, and a simple mechanical contrivance,
by which a large quantity of mineral could be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
down at one time, would save an enormous amount of labour,
and therefore expense. A cable railway would answer the
purpose to perfection, and the cost of running the steam
motor would be insignificant, owing to the amount of wood
and coal found within easy reach. I passed through a large
gorge in the mountain, and finally reached the summit of
Yuzan. Walking on sulphur beds is like walking on ice, and
many a time in the climb I landed on my knees. Near the
summit is a huge pinnacle of volcanic rock, standing up perpendicularly,
and of impossible access. From the foot of this
pinnacle a lovely view of the Kutcharo Lake is obtained, and
it has as a background chain after chain of thickly-wooded
mountains, beyond which are visible Oakan and Moyokan,
two volcanic peaks, respectively four thousand and three
thousand four hundred feet above the level of the sea. On
Moyokan are some hot springs and accumulations of sulphur.
Both these peaks can be seen from the coast on a clear day.
A small lake lies between Moyokan and Oakan, which takes
its name from the latter mountain, and finds an outlet in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Oakan River. The Oakan joins the Kutcharo River not far
from the sea.</p>

<span class="caption">KUTCHARO LAKE FROM MOUNT YUZAN.</span>
</div>

<p>The descent was easier than the ascent, and I put up at
a small tea-house, the only one in the place. The landlord
promised to get me a good pony early the next morning, but,
like a true Japanese, he did not keep his promise. He called
me at 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, saying that the pony would be ready in a few
minutes, and at 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the quadruped had not put in an
appearance; and after numberless excuses, compliments, bows,
and lies, the landlord acknowledged that no ponies were to be
had. I gave my luggage to a railway <i>employé</i>, who undertook
to bring it back to Shibetcha, and I started on foot for Lake
Kutcharo. From Yuzan a track across the mountains goes
due north to Abashiri, on the north-east coast. I went in a
south-westerly direction, and as on the previous day from the
summit of Yuzan I had noted the position of Lake Kutcharo,
I had no difficulty in finding my way there; in fact, I came
upon a small Ainu track leading to it. A delightful walk of
ten miles in the forest took me to the Ainu village of
Kutcharo, on the borders of the lake of the same name. The
village is a miserable one; it differs from all other Ainu
villages in its huts, which have semicircular roofs instead of
angular ones, as is the case with the Ainu of Volcano Bay and
of the Saru and Tokachi Rivers. I entered some of the huts,
and in a few minutes I was surrounded by the small population&mdash;I
daresay about twenty souls, all included&mdash;whom I
led out into the open air to see what they were like. They
appeared to me smaller than other Ainu, and their bones were
less massive; they were not so hairy, and more inclined to
baldness. Their garments were wretched, and resembled
those worn by the Tokachi Ainu; namely, a few rags held
together one could scarcely say how. Women were tattooed
on their lips and arms, but less extensively than are those of
other tribes, and the tattooing was not so accurately done.</p>

<p>Other Ainu whom I met in the forest in the neighbourhood
of this village bore the same characteristics, and everyone
seemed to be curiously melancholy and depressed. An Ainu
existence is certainly not one's ideal of comfort and hilarity,
but their gloom and melancholy seem to me to be purely
racial and congenital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
The Lake Kutcharo is very large&mdash;too large to be seen to
advantage from its borders, as one can see only parts, and not
the whole of it at once. It has a pretty island in the centre,
and on the west side is a peninsula projecting almost as far as
the island. On this peninsula a small active geyser is found,
which rises to a height of about twelve feet, and acts spasmodically.
The high mountains which surround the lake would
make the latter a pleasant summer resort were the place
within the circle of civilisation. The scenery is very similar to
that of Norway or the Scotch lakes. The Kutcharo River, as
can be seen on the map, is an outlet of the Lake Kutcharo,
into which the waters of the latter discharge themselves a few
hundred yards west of the Ainu village.</p>

<span class="caption">SULPHUR MINE.</span>
</div>

<p>An Ainu pointed out to me the track leading to Tetcha, or
Tetchkanga, and I directed my steps in that direction, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Ainu having informed me that it was very far, and that
I could only reach it at night. I crossed the stream in a
"dug-out," and found the track on the other side. I walked
fast, for the most part through a thickly-wooded country, and
at about sunset I reached Tetcha. The distance from Kutcharo,
I should think, is about ten or twelve miles. Tetcha is
an Ainu village, near which a few Japanese houses have been
built. The Kutcharo River intersects it, and the sulphur
train from Yuzan stops here to take water on its way to
Shibetcha. The train had gone through some hours previously,
and I was left the alternative of walking on to
Shibetcha, twenty miles further, or of sleeping at Tetcha. I
had walked twenty or twenty-two miles already that day, and
I felt in very good form. I knew that it would be full moon
that night; and walking through a forest by moonlight has
always had a great charm for me. Watching the shadows,
with their thousand different fantastic forms, running in and
out through the trees and playing round them, has the same
weird fascination for me as one of Tieck's tales, or the
suggestive music of an æolian harp. Some of the Ainu and a
Jap entreated me not to attempt to cross the forest at night,
for wolves and bears were numerous, they said, and in all
probability I should be attacked by them. This last announcement,
which I was destined to hear every day in Yezo, and
which, of course, I did not believe, decided me to go, and I
started.</p>

<p>"But," cried after me the astonished Japanese, "<i>anata micci
wakarimasen</i>!"&mdash;"You do not know the way!"</p>

<p>"<i>Kamaimasen, Sayonara!</i>"&mdash;"It little matters; good-bye!"
was my reply; and I left him standing there perplexed, looking
after me as if I had been a phenomenon.</p>

<p>The Japanese in Yezo and the Ainu never on any account
travel far at night; and as for going through a forest alone,
unprotected, and without knowing the way, they evidently
regarded it as something more reprehensible than folly. Two
days previously, when in the train, I had noticed that the railway
described a curve several miles long, and I knew then
that by cutting across I could considerably shorten my way.
When I entered the forest, the sun with its last rays was
casting warm tints on the tops of the pine-trees. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
was still, and only now and then some huge owl, awakened by
the noise of my steps from its day's long sleep, would fly
away, starting off on its night's peregrinations and depredations.
I walked mile after mile, and finally struck the
rails again. On a white post I saw a cipher in Chinese
characters, which brought me back to the reality that I was
still seventeen miles away from Shibetcha. I followed the line
of rail as closely as I could, and late at night I reached
Shibetcha. I roused the people at the <i>Marui yadoya</i>, and,
having eaten some salmon and water soup, I retired to my
<i>foutangs</i>, between which, it is useless to say, I slept well. I
had walked forty-two odd miles that day, and it had been a
pleasant change from the continuous riding on pack-saddles.</p>

<p>The next day I rode down to the coast to the bay of
Akkeshi, about forty-two miles east of Kushiro. The road
is very good all the way, and has on each side woods of oak
and pine trees. The traffic on it is at present very small, and
the only living creatures I saw during the twenty-eight or thirty
miles were a beautiful long-tailed red fox and a number of
Japanese convicts led by a policeman. These were dressed in
red trousers and a short red coat made of coarse material.
They were walking in a row, and they were chained two by
two, and, moreover, a long rope joined the chain of each couple
to that of the next, so that all couples were tied together.
The end of this rope was held by the policeman. Some of
them wore large hats entirely covering their face; others wore
no hat at all, and had their head shaved in a peculiar manner.
They were mostly bare-footed, but a few wore straw sandals.
The Government wisely makes use of these convicts in opening
roads and other public works, and after their term of punishment
is expired, these men almost invariably become fishermen.
A great part of the Japanese population of Yezo is
composed of exiles and ex-convicts; in other words, Yezo is
nothing more or less to Japan than what Australia was to
England some years ago.</p>

<p>Nearing the coast I passed the "Tonden" of Hondemura, a
colonial militia farming settlement. A long line of new houses,
all exactly alike in shape and size, and built at intervals,
stretches on each side of the wide road. Each of these houses
is inhabited by a man who has served his time as a soldier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and who has now his family about him, and does work as a
farmer in this settlement assigned to him. These "Tondens"
were established by the Government, and I believe that the
farmer-soldiers give fairly good results in the zeal and industry
with which they cultivate the land, and the honesty and
morality of their lives. I saw most of them occupied in
stubbing up the scrub, and tearing or cutting down the trees,
burning the more worthless parts; but it will be some years
yet before they have cleared an area of cultivable land sufficiently
large for profit, as the country is very thickly wooded
in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Soon after I had passed the settlement, going down a steep
hill I came upon a small and dirty semi-Ainu village, and ultimately
reached the seashore.</p>

<p>The distance from Shibetcha is thirty miles, and the riding
was beginning to be unpleasant, owing to the gathering darkness,
which made my pony shy at everything it passed. At
the mouth of the Pehambe Ushi River I had great difficulty in
getting my pony on the ferry-boat, which was to take me
across the mouth of the lagoon to Akkeshi. Several drunken
fishermen came on board, and were disagreeably noisy. One
of these fellows had a pony, which he tied to mine when on
board. The ferry was to take us across the entrance of the
Akkeshi lagoon, and it was more than a quarter of an hour
before we reached the opposite shore. When we were still
nearly twenty feet from <i>terra firma</i>, my pony, frightened at
the cries of the drunken crowd, jumped overboard, carrying
with him his companion steed. The sudden shock and lurch
of the boat knocked down everybody on board, and nearly
capsized us. As it was we shipped a lot of water. The ponies
found the water deeper than they expected, and they had to
swim for it. Having landed before he came ashore, I recaptured
mine, gave him a sound thrashing, and rode on to
Akkeshi, a few hundred yards from the landing-place. Akkeshi
lies at the north-east side of the large bay which goes by
the same name, and which, by the way, is probably one of the
best anchorages on the south coast of Yezo. The mouth
of the bay is to the southward; it extends seven miles in a
northerly direction, and is about six miles wide in its widest
part. The bay is prolonged further inland by a large lagoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
called Se-Cherippe, which contains many shoals and low
islands, near which are beds of oysters of enormous size, the
shells of some measuring as much as eighteen inches in length.
The Koro-pok-kuru, by whom this district was formerly thickly
populated, seem to have relished this diet, as we find thick
beds of discarded shells on the top of some of the lower hills,
and in many places, especially in the vicinity of pits. These
shell heaps are similar to those found on the main island
of Nippon, and attributed to the Ainu. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_78">Chapter IX.</a>)</p>

<p>The country round the bay and the lagoon forms a high
land or plateau between two hundred and three hundred feet
above the level of the sea, and the higher ground is thickly
wooded, thus supplying Akkeshi with abundance of timber,
mostly of evergreen trees, as Todo and Yezo-matzu, two
spruces common in other parts of Yezo as well. With its good
harbour, its large export of oysters, salmon, herrings, fish-manure,
and seaweed, besides its seal-fishery and the quantity
of good timber easily cut and transported down the lagoon
and across the bay for shipment, it is not surprising that
Akkeshi has become, after Hakodate, the most important
centre on the southern coast. It is nearly half as large again
as Kushiro, and has as many as nine hundred Japanese houses,
besides sixty or seventy Ainu huts.</p>

<p>The Ainu were formerly extremely numerous in this
district; but few of them are left now, and those few are
indeed poor specimens of their race. They have nearly all
become bald, and they seem to suffer very severely from
rheumatism. Thick fogs are very prevalent along the coast,
and it is but seldom that one can obtain a view of the whole
bay. These fogs naturally render navigation unsafe, and are
one of the great drawbacks to the prosperity of the place.
However, our good Londoners could tell us that greater evils
than fogs can exist. I have no doubt that at some future
date we shall hear of Akkeshi as being the most important
port in Yezo, when a railway to join it to Shibetcha shall have
been constructed. The sulphur of Mount Yuzan will probably
then be taken direct to this place instead of Kushiro, owing to
the safety of its harbour, an advantage which Kushiro does
not possess. The Akkeshi Bay is also interesting from a
picturesque point of view, when fogs give one a chance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
seeing the surrounding scenery. Some fine headlands are
found near the town of Akkeshi, and also on each side of the
opening of the bay into the ocean. On the eastern side, the
two islands of Daikuku and Kodaikuku, joined to the mainland
by the low reef, slightly under water-level, which goes round
the bay, are of some importance for an artist. This is
especially true of the larger island of Daikuku, which rises at a
considerable height above the sea, forming majestic cliffs,
beautiful in shape and colour, on which myriads of seagulls,
albatrosses, and penguins have chosen their abode, finding in
these almost untrodden and picturesque cliffs a safe place in
which to lay their eggs and rear their young. Here they live
undisturbed, save for the dashing waves of the ocean, which
make the earth tremble and the rock crumble to pieces, but
only meet with a blithesome welcome from the screaming,
light-hearted, fat, and lazy-winged inhabitants, to whom those
waves bring good stores of daily food.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="small">From Akkeshi to Nemuro&mdash;A Horse Station&mdash;Nemuro and its People.</span></h2>


<p>The road in the proximity of Akkeshi was extremely muddy
and slippery, owing to the continuous fogs and rain. A north
wind was blowing hard the day I left for Kiritap, and it drove
the mist and drizzly rain right through one's skin into one's
bones. The fogs, which are prevalent all along the coast,
seem to excel between Akkeshi and Kiritap; so much so that
the Japanese in the neighbourhood make them answerable for
their baldness, and the local Ainu say they are so scantily
hirsute because of the everlasting dampness in which they live.
They clinch their argument by reminding you that when their
forefathers came to this part of the coast they were as hairy
as the bear, so what can have caused their own comparative
smoothness but these everlasting fogs? I believe that to a
great extent they are right, for when, after a day's wet ride, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
have sat near a fire even for some hours, I have felt as if my
skin were soaking with wet&mdash;as if I had been too long in a
bath&mdash;and neither rubbing with cotton towels nor the warmth
of the fire seemed thoroughly to dry it; and perhaps such an
extraordinary dampness, constantly saturating the pores of
the skin, may have an injurious effect upon the hair, and cause
it to decay and fall off. It was in a thick fog like this that
I had to find my way to Riruran, the next horse station, about
eight miles further east. The road soon became a mere track,
running through an undulating country, chiefly pasture land.
As luck would have it, I had hired a pony which belonged to
the Riruran station, and the beast was as anxious to get there
as I was. He knew the way and I did not, so I let him guide
me. Now and then, when the wind blew with increased
strength, the fog lifted for a few minutes, and disclosed some
pretty bits of landscape. The country all around was grassy,
with the familiar densely-wooded hills in the background. It
somewhat resembled the slopes and high lands of Cornwall,
without, however, the herds of sheep and cattle, which in our
country are connected with green fields; without the trim
fences and stiles, the ploughed fields and meadows, the trim
hedges and park-like trees, the bye-lanes and well-kept roads.</p>

<p>Hill after hill was ascended and descended, the sturdy little
pony going well towards his former home; but as yet I had
come on no signs of any living creature. No labourers are
here to work and plough the dark rich soil. Potato fields;
cottages with their plots of vegetable grounds; cows and sheep
scattered over the green pastures&mdash;all signs of vigorous and
successful husbandry&mdash;are things that an intending traveller
to Yezo will miss. Everywhere are solitude and monotony.
Still, even solitude and monotony are not always to be
abhorred, and if they have their drawbacks they also have
their advantages. You can go undisturbed for mile after
mile; you can think; you can dream; you can sing; you can
keep to the track or go across country; you can go fast or
slow, and there is no one to object, to obstruct, or to comment.
You breathe air that no one has breathed before, and you
quench your thirst in a limpid stream unpolluted by sewage,
chemical refuse, or poisonous dye-stuffs. You lead a simple
life, and, what is more, an independent life. Many a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
when I woke up to the real state of my new condition, I
could not help laughing at our civilised conceptions of what
constitutes a free man in a free country, viz. that he can have
a voice in choosing which of two men shall be sent as a
member to Parliament.</p>

<p>Absorbed, now in my own thoughts on many subjects, and
now in gazing at the monotonous scenes, which, as if reflected
from a magic-lantern, suddenly appeared and as suddenly
faded away, I had not seen how far my pony had hurried on,
when, rapidly descending a steep hill, I discerned through the
grey fog a solitary shed in the small valley below. The
neighing of my steed, responded to by the neighing of his
compatriots in the valley, told me that I had reached the
horse station of Riruran, and a few minutes later my baggage
and pack-saddle were removed from my steaming quadruped,
and a fresh animal was burdened with my possessions. These
horse stations generally consist of one shed, in which the
owner and his family live; near it is a rough enclosure formed
of branches and trunks of trees laid down horizontally, and
strengthened at intervals by poles stuck in the ground. The
ponies are kept in this enclosure during the day, but are let
loose at sunset, when they go for their food wherever they can
get it&mdash;generally on the near hills. Early in the morning one
or two Ainu employed in the stations start off to recapture
the ponies, and after a struggle bring back the herd to the
paddock. My readers, who may not be well acquainted with
the habits of semi-wild horses, will wonder that the ponies,
once free in an unenclosed country, do not bolt away altogether
inland, thus making it impossible to recapture them;
and, moreover, these readers will think what a difficult task it
must be for the Ainu horsemen to recover all the ponies, each
one of which, they probably imagine, has bolted in an independent
and different direction. This is not the case. When
a herd of ponies is let loose they invariably all go together in
one direction, generally following those of the older animals
which have bells hanging to their necks. When they come to a
proper feeding-ground they all graze within a few yards of one
another; and the chances are that the herd will not go a step
further than is necessary, as they are terribly afraid of bears,
their most dreaded enemy, by which they well know the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
distant hills are infested. When their hunger is satisfied they
shoulder up together and form a circle, in the centre of which
the young colts are placed, these being thus well protected
from bears, who would find a sturdy resistance in the hind
hoofs of the outstanding guard should they come to close
quarters. The Ainu are good trackers, and have little difficulty
in finding in which direction the herd has moved. When this
preliminary is ascertained, the horseman, mounted on a swift
pony, which he has taken good care to keep behind, starts
from the station about an hour before sunrise, so as to allow
himself ample time to reach the herd before the sun is up.
He finds the ponies in this circular position of defence. With
a long stick he breaks their ranks, and by shouting, and
wildly galloping to and fro, drives them on in front till the
station and the pen are reached. When they have all entered
the latter, a heavy wooden bar is rested on two biforked poles,
one on each side of the entrance, thus barring their way out;
and there they are kept all day, waiting for such native
travellers or traders as may require their services along the
coast.</p>

<p>Most of the stations are owned by Japanese and by Ainu
half-castes. Some have large numbers of ponies; some only
a few, according to the wants of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The average market value of a beast is between five and
ten <i>yen</i>, or about fifteen to thirty shillings in English currency.</p>

<p>At stations where the ponies are but little worked, good
animals can sometimes be obtained for a small sum of money;
but at stations near large settlements&mdash;where trade with other
villages is carried on entirely by pack-ponies&mdash;they are mostly
sorry beasts, with their backs one mass of sores, produced by
the friction of the rough pack-saddles. Moreover, the cruel
habit of letting colts follow mares for long distances&mdash;sometimes
forty or fifty miles&mdash;is as painful a sight to witness as it
is injurious to the breed. The Yezo ponies are characterised
by their long hair and mane. They are short, sturdy, punchy
brutes, not more than ten or twelve hands high, with a rather
large and massive head, and thick, crooked legs. They are by
no means fine-looking animals, nor are they well groomed&mdash;in
fact, they are not groomed at all&mdash;but they serve capitally for
the rough tracks and precipitous wastes of Hokkaido. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
have none of the good qualities we require in our horses, but
they possess others which fit them for the country they are in.
Their enormous power of endurance, and the wonderful way
in which they can go over the steepest tracks&mdash;almost unclimbable
on foot; their sure step when going along precipices; and
the marvellous manner in which they pick their way over
rocky coasts, which the waves would seem to make impassable,
and where none of our good horses could go without breaking
their legs, are all endowments which I feel bound to quote in
honour of the Yezo ponies. They are not shod, and they can
hardly be called trained. Indeed, if a traveller be a good
rider, it is advisable to obtain a perfectly unbroken animal,
as from my own personal experience I can say that, though
the riding was a little more exciting, I could invariably make
better time with a totally unbroken beast, than with one of
the worn-out, sore-backed "quiet ponies," which needed any
amount of thrashing to make him go.</p>

<p>A curious method is adopted for directing the animal. It is
as simple as it is ingenious. The necessary "bit" by which
we control our horses is dispensed with, and it is replaced by
two wooden wands about twelve inches long and two inches
wide, tied together at one end, allowing a distance of three
inches between them. In the middle of these wands a rope is
passed which goes over the pony's head behind its ears; while
the wands themselves, thus supported by it, rest one on each
side of the pony's nose. Another rope, five or six feet in
<span class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-110.png" width="300" height="183" alt="" title="AINU BITS" />
<span class="caption">AINU BITS.</span></span>
length, and acting as a rein, is fastened
at the lower end of one of
the wands, and passes through a
hole in the other, thus allowing
this simple contrivance, based on
the lever principle, to be worked
exactly in the same
way as a nut-cracker,
the pony's nose
being the nut. The
disadvantage of the
system is, that
having only one rein, this has to be passed over the pony's
head each time one wishes to turn to the right or to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
left, as by pulling the rope hard, and thus squeezing the
animal's nose, its head is turned in the direction in which it is
pulled, and it is soon taught that this is the way it must go.
Furthermore, should the pony bolt, it can be stopped by
pulling its head close to its haunches, thereby making it
impossible to continue its race. In the latter case it often
happens, especially with an untrained pony, that it will spin
round, trying to stretch its twisted neck by pushing its head
away from the side of its body, and the result is generally a
bad fall of horse and rider.</p>

<p>Another thing of which one ought to be careful is to keep
one's legs out of the reach of the brute's teeth; for it is
not infrequent that instead of the man punishing the animal,
the animal revenges itself on the man; and the incautious
traveller realises Sydney Smith's position, and finds that to a
Yezo pony, as well as to an English cart-horse, "all flesh is
grass."</p>

<p>From Riruran, for about fifteen miles, the way is merely
a mountain track; and I dare say that in fine weather the
scenery along it is picturesque. Unfortunately, when I went
through, the fog had become more and more intense, and I
saw very little of the landscape. At places the track led down
to the sea, and then mounted up again over cliffs and high
lands. As the mist, which came in gusts and waves, deepened
or lightened in intensity, the rugged precipitous rocks, formed
mostly of conglomerate, sandstone, and breccia, took all sorts
of fantastic forms. Along the coast were many Ainu huts
inhabited by half-castes and by Japanese. The Ainu were
once very numerous in this district, but few of them are to be
found now. The few remaining ones have yielded to the more
civilised Japanese, and have become their servants. They are
used as menials in most of the fishing stations, always acting
under the directions of Japanese masters. Very frequently they
are employed as tenders of horses, and in some places as
guides for traders and travellers from one station to another.</p>

<p>Not far from Riruran the mouths of two lagoons have to be
crossed, the larger of which is called Saruffo-Ko, or "Lake in
a grassy plain." Cranes, swans, and ducks are numerous in
these lagoons.</p>

<p>The track continues mostly over cliffs and mountains till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Birvase, a small village of seaweed gatherers, is reached, and
the next two and a half miles are along a sandy beach as far
as Hammanaka. A short bridge joins this place to the island
of Kiritap, which is separated from the mainland by a channel
only a few feet wide. Towards the evening the fog lifted, and
I caught a glimpse of the village.</p>

<p>The ponies of the Kiritap village had just been let loose,
and were running over the small wooden bridge with great
clamour. The houses, which number about a hundred and
twenty, are all poor and dirty. There is a main street, and
most of the houses are on each side of it. The people are
fishermen, seaweed gatherers, and small traders; for Hammanaka
Bay, being a good anchorage for junks and small craft
under the lee of Kiritap Island, is a place of some importance
for its export trade of seaweeds, fish-oil, and herring guano;
these products being sent down to Hakodate.</p>

<p>If a few Ainu have adopted the Japanese language, clothes,
and customs, there are also many Japanese who have taken
up the Ainu language and ways. I noticed this more particularly
in this district, where the Ainu have almost entirely disappeared.
The older Japanese and many of the younger folks
have Ainu features; and not only have they adopted a great
number of Ainu words, but when talking Japanese they speak
it with the peculiar intonation and accent pertaining to the
Ainu. This is not surprising, nor yet peculiar to the Japanese
or the Chinese; for we find that almost all English residents
in Chinese ports adopt many of the words of our pig-tailed
brothers, and have thus formed a kind of local English, besides
the "pidgeon-English"&mdash;a corruption of "business English"&mdash;which
almost constitutes a language of its own.</p>

<p>The Ainu, like the Scotch or the French, give a rolling
sound to the "r." Thus, for instance, if I had written the
word "Riruran" as it is pronounced I should have spelt it
"Rrirrurran." Then the Ainu almost sing their words&mdash;the
women in a falsetto voice, ending in a singularly mournful
kind of cadenza. On his return from a journey, a hunt, or a
fishing expedition, the Ainu squats down cross-legged in his
hut, and, after the conventional introductory ceremony of
rubbing the palms of his hands together and then repeatedly
stroking his hair and beard, proceeds to relate the adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
that have befallen him during his absence. This he does by
singing out his story in a sort of monotone, or sometimes
chanting it. When conversing with Japanese the Ainu have
slightly modified this habit, which gave rise to much mirth to
the light-hearted sons of the Mikado's empire. However,
like all people who are ready to laugh at everything novel, the
local Japanese have now themselves fallen into that same
manner of speaking, which, after all, has its charms, as it
is rather sentimental in spirit, and so far pleasant to the
ear. What is more, they have also acquired the slow ways
of the Ainu.</p>

<p>All along the beach between Hammanaka and Hattaushi,
a distance of nearly twenty miles, there are fishermen's and
seaweed gatherers' huts; but none of them is inhabited by
Ainu. Men, women, and children are all occupied in the
seaweed gathering industry; and it is when the sea is stormy
that the largest quantity of kelp is collected. The numerous
reefs and rocks all along the shore-line afford suitable ground
and bottom for its growth and production; and during a
stormy sea quantities of kelp float on the breaking waves, to
be finally thrown on shore. The industrious gatherers seldom
wait for this "jetsam," as the long weeds, after they are
washed off the rock, and before they are finally swept on shore,
are apt to be damaged by the waves, and are therefore of less
value for the export market than when long and fresh;
wherefore, each gatherer provides himself with a long pole or
hook, and from morning till night these half-naked "toilers of
the sea" can be seen running to and fro in and out of the
waves dragging bunches of long ribbon-like seaweeds, which
are then carefully disentangled, stretched on the sands to dry,
and, after several days of exposure, are packed for the market.</p>

<p>Some huge cliffs towering over the sandy beach make the
track interesting; and here and there, scattered in the
Hammanaka Bay, are some oyster-banks before reaching the
single shed of Hattaushi. The following twelve miles were
on an extremely bad track, partly over steep hills and partly
on tiresome soft sand. Then I arrived at Otchishi&mdash;without
exception the loveliest little spot in Yezo. It lies in the centre
of a small bay, on the two sides of which are magnificent
headlands with precipitous cliffs and rocks of volcanic formation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
On a pretty bit of green grass in the foreground, only a
few feet above the sea-level, were a shed and a storehouse. A
reef and shallow water closed the entrance of the bay to the
foaming waves of the Pacific. In the sheltered water, which
was as smooth as a mirror, the dark rich colour of the
overhanging rocks, caressed by the last warm rays of the dying
sun, was reflected with absolute fidelity and almost increased
loveliness. A cold whitish sky, and the <i>white horses</i> breaking
on the reef, completed the <i>ensemble</i> of that lovely scene; and it
was with great regret, after having attempted a sketch, that I
was told my horse was ready, and I had to leave this poetical
and exquisite scene.</p>

<p>On the slight elevations near Otchishi, and in the valley,
pits are still to be seen, showing that the pit-dwellers were
once numerous in this district. They are found both along
the coast as well as slightly inland by the side of small rivers,
and on the shores of the Saruffu lagoon. A well-kept road
begins at Otchishi, and goes on to Nemuro. At first it runs
over hilly ground and through an oak-wooded country, then
through thick forests of spruce trees, the trees standing very
close together. About four miles from Nemuro a military
settlement&mdash;"Hanasaki"&mdash;similar to the one on the Shibetcha-Akkeshi
road, has been established by the Japanese Government.
Here, again, I was struck by the difficulty and the
amount of labour involved in clearing the trees off the ground.
It will take many years before the industrious farmers will
have any return for their hard labour. I do not know what
the object of the Japanese Government may have been
in starting these two militia settlements in spots so
unfit for cultivation, but it seems a great pity to see the
Tokachi region, which has all the requisites for successful
agriculture, quite deserted, while hundreds of men are
wasting their strength and time at other places, where it
will take several years to open enough ground for even a
kitchen-garden.</p>

<p>Past the long row of houses at Hanasaki the road descends
gently, and I arrived at Nemuro, a thriving place of about
fifteen hundred houses, on the south-west coast of the plateau-like
peninsula ending at Cape Noshafu. The general elevation
of the plateau is between sixty and one hundred and twenty feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
above the sea-level, and the high land is covered with undergrowth
and stunted trees, such as scrub bamboo, oak, birch,
and alder, the east winds and fogs no doubt preventing the
latter from attaining a larger growth. Some low islands and
reefs lie north and south off Cape Noshafu, and make navigation
very unsafe for the small coasting crafts which sometimes
during the summer call at Nemuro for sea-weed, herring,
salt, salmon, and herring guano; the first exported chiefly to
China, the others to Tokio and Southern Japan. Herrings are
caught in large numbers during the spring and summer, and
the export of fish-manure would be considerably increased if
the harbour at Nemuro could be safely entered by larger
ships. As it is now, though well sheltered by the small island
of Bentenjima, it can only harbour small ships, as, besides not
being deep, its entrance is narrow and of difficult access during
the thick fogs of the summer. In the winter and part of the
spring the harbour and the coast as far as Noshafu Cape are
blocked with drift ice, thus stopping navigation altogether.
The trade from the adjoining coast and the Kurile Islands
concentrates at this port, and as a farming region the small
portion of available land north-west of the town has given fairly
good results. Horse-breeding has proved a success for the
local wants, but hardly so in producing a fine breed of horses.
Cattle-breeding, on the other hand, has been a failure all
through, owing to the severe weather in winter, which
the imported animals could not stand. In spite of strong
easterly winds, heavy fogs, ice, and snow, fair crops of <i>daikon</i>,
potatoes, turnips, barley, beans, wheat, and hemp are successfully
raised here, as the soil is of extremely good quality. As
to the town itself, it is prettily laid out, the streets crossing
each other at right angles, while some of the houses
are built in semi-European style, to meet the severity of
the climate. A Shinto temple is erected on the high
level; and from this is obtained a fine bird's-eye view of the
harbour and town, with the numerous storehouses overlooking
the sea.</p>

<p>As I have given a short description of the town&mdash;uninteresting
save from a commercial point of view&mdash;I feel that I owe a
few lines to its go-ahead inhabitants. Belonging, nearly all, to
a young and adventurous generation, they reminded me of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
same type of Englishmen who have abandoned their fatherland
and settled in America and Australia, striving, and often
succeeding, in making a fortune. Such men are invariably of
a different "make" from that of the young fellows who are
satisfied to drudge for life in a bank, a merchant's office, or a
shop&mdash;vegetating rather than living; following their day's
routine in a mechanical sort of way; grumbling continually,
but never bold enough to attempt any improvement of their
position. As one is born an artist, a musician, or a literary
man, one has to be born a colonist to be a successful one.</p>

<p>The young Japanese whom I met at Nemuro impressed
me as being thoroughly different from any I had come across
in my one year's stay in Southern Japan; and I was agreeably
surprised when I found that I was dealing with a lot of young,
clever, and serious men, willing to improve their country and
themselves, and anxious to accept any practical hint that
would enable them to accomplish this in the shortest time
possible. In other words, they had lost the slow, phlegmatic
way of transacting business of the "stay-at-homes," and had
accepted the quick perception of the true colonist, who is
always ready to catch all the chances which will help him to
get on in life.</p>

<p>I had been struck with this energy, this go-ahead faculty,
several times along the south-west and south-east coasts,
when conversing with the Japanese with whom I came in
contact; but I was never so much impressed as at Nemuro,
where, indeed, the men are of a superior class, well-educated,
and belonging to good families, while most of the Japanese at
fishing stations along the coast are taken from the scum of
the towns. They are often escaped or ex-convicts, or else
people who found it advisable to abandon the livelier shores
of Nippon, leaving no trace of themselves rather than end
their days in a prison cell.</p>

<p>Nemuro is a progressive place in every way, and had it been
built five miles further west it would have been intersected by
the Onnetto River&mdash;a short outlet of the Onnetto Lagoon,
which would have formed a larger and safer harbour than the
present Nemuro anchorage. As it is, prosperity showed itself
in the usual way, by the number of eating-houses for all
classes, a theatre, numerous <i>guechas</i>&mdash;singers and dancers&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
a whole street of houses of light morals, in which, behind
a wooden grating similar to a huge cage, dozens of girls are
shown in their gaudy red and gold embroidered <i>kimonos</i>, with
elaborate <i>obis</i> round their waist, and expensive long tortoise-shell
hairpins artistically surrounding their heads like a halo.
There in a line the pretty girls sit for several hours on their
heels in front of a <i>hibachi</i>&mdash;brazier&mdash;smoking their diminutive
pipes. They are fair game for now the compliments and now
the jokes of the crowd promenading up and down the street
in the evening. Every now and then, when an admirer approaches
the cage, one of the girls gets up, refills her tiny pipe
with tobacco, and offers it to him, not forgetting to wipe the
mouthpiece with the palm of her hand before so doing. He
(the admirer) puffs away, and returns the empty pipe with
thanks, shifting on to another cage to have his next smoke.
Japanese men cannot live without <i>guechas</i>, and it follows as a
matter of course that Nemuro, being a prosperous place, there
are many of them.</p>

<p>A <i>guecha</i> is a singer or dancer (posturing), or both, and one
or more generally attend dinner-parties and festivities of any
kind. Some sing with self-accompaniment of <i>shamesen;</i> others
display their wonderful powers of mimicking and posturising,
in which grace is never lacking. A long <i>kimono</i>, a carefully-arranged
<i>obi</i>, and a pretty pair of white <i>tabi</i>&mdash;short socks with
split toes&mdash;make up the graceful and simple attire in which
they appear in the house. Their hair, plastered down with
camelia oil, is a veritable work of art. It is carefully combed,
oiled, and flattened behind the ears. A metal fastener at the
lowest point of the curve keeps it in this flat position, and it is
then raised again and fastened at the back of the head, first in
a most elaborate twist, and then rolled up in graceful curves.
A pretty, tasteful <i>kanzashi</i>&mdash;a long hairpin&mdash;is placed on the
left side of the head, thus completing that part of a <i>guecha's</i>
toilette.</p>

<p>The sallow complexion characteristic of the race is despised
by the womankind of Japan, and all women are given to
"painting" themselves. With us such a custom is not uncommon,
but it is disregarded by most sensible women.
In Japan it is part of the ordinary woman's daily toilette. A
thick layer of white chalk is first smeared with a soft brush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
over the face, neck, shoulders, arms, and hands; then the pretty
<i>mouseme</i>, dipping her first finger in red paint, gently rubs this
on her cheeks, her temples, and over the upper eyelids. The
middle finger is the "black brush," and adds sentiment to the
expression by blackening under the eyes; and sometimes when
the eyebrows are not shaved it is also used to accentuate
them. A piece of burnt cork is often used as a substitute for
black paint. The fourth finger has no occupation, but the little
finger is for finishing touches, brightening up the mouth with
carmine, and adding a bit of gold on the lower lip. A <i>guecha</i>
paints herself to a much greater extent than other women, and
with brighter colours. As to her moral qualities, a <i>guecha</i> is
usually not immoral enough to be called "fast," yet too fast to
be qualified as "moral." Their music and posturing have
a great charm for Japanese; and when money is made, a good
quantity of it goes to keeping up these feminine musicians and
their establishments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To show how enterprising and Americanised the Nemuro
people are, I shall ask the reader's forgiveness for again
relating a personal experience which at the time greatly
amused me.</p>

<p>I was in the midst of my simple Japanese dinner in
the Jamaruru tea-house, when four youths entered my
room and offered to shake hands with me&mdash;a most unusual
thing with Japanese. One of them handed me his card,
on which I read, "K. Sato, <i>Nemuro Shimbun</i>" (Nemuro
newspaper).</p>

<p>"Oh," I said in Japanese, "you have even a newspaper at
Nemuro."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered in English one of his friends, a Mr. Yuasa,
handing me his own card.</p>

<p>"You speak English, then, Mr. Yuasa?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can I offer you and your friends anything to drink or to
eat?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What will you have?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
"Will you have some <i>sake</i>?"</p>

<p>"No, no; I come to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"No, no; I come to <i>take your life</i> in Nemuro newspaper.
Please speak where come? How old? Where go?"</p>

<p>When I had sufficiently recovered from the shock of his
announcement that he had come to take my life, and understood
what he meant by it, I had a most pleasant conversation in
English with him, and in Japanese with the others. Mr. Yuasa's
English improved as his shyness wore off, showing that he had
a very fair knowledge of the language. The interview lasted
many hours, continually interrupted by the <i>nara honto</i> and
the <i>sajo deska</i>&mdash;"really" and "indeed" of my visitors&mdash;while
notes were taken by the editor and his staff. They finally
departed, and early the next morning I received the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I long that you will correspond to me any events
wherever you have met them in your journey when you are
not so awful busy, as I have to translate and write on the
Nemuro <i>News</i>. I meet the first time here, and I hope to
have your friendly favor hitherto, and thanks for your kindness
I have received ever, believe me, your humble servant,
F. <span class="smcap">Yuasa</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The same afternoon the editor and his staff called again,
accompanied by the two Mr. Nakamuras, the richest merchants
in Nemuro, and they insisted on giving me a European dinner.
After my experience at Otsu as regards European cooking by
Japanese, I was rather loth to accept their kind invitation, but I
had to yield. The feast began with biscuits and jam,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and the
soup was brought immediately after; then vegetables were
followed by roast chicken, and the latter by salad and fried fish.
With the exception of the somewhat inverted order of the
courses, this time it was actually a European dinner, and even
well-cooked; but my hosts were seen at a great disadvantage
when using a knife and fork. As for the anatomy of the
chicken, that was decidedly their weakest point. Those of
the party who were shy gave up the carving as a bad job; the
bolder only fought bravely; and every now and then a knife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
gave a terrible squeak on the plate, and half a leg, a wing, or a
carcase was fired right across the table into one's plate, if not
in one's face, or on one's lap.</p>

<p>"<i>Honto taihen muskashi</i>"&mdash;"Really it is very difficult"&mdash;said
the wit of the party, helplessly putting down his knife and
fork after trying to separate the two parts of a wing. "This
bird's bones have lost all their joints in the cooking."</p>

<p>My hosts were extremely kind, and were, besides, so clever
and bright that I enjoyed their good company immensely.
At the same time I gained from them valuable information as
regards the neighbouring country and the Kurile Islands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="small">The Kurile Islands.</span></h2>


<p>From Nemuro I put to sea in a miserable little Japanese
craft&mdash;a kind of tug-boat&mdash;which once or twice a year goes to
the principal islands of the Kurile group, and brings back their
products to Nemuro. It is needless to say that I was the only
passenger on board, though it is fair to add that the saloon
was large enough to "accommodate" two, but not more. As
for the only cabin, it had two berths, one over the other, but
no available space for dressing or undressing, which therefore
had to be got through outside, unless it was to be done by
instalments, lying down in the berth itself. I shall spare my
readers a minute description of this "ocean clipper," her
tonnage, and horse-power, and I shall not attempt to narrate
the many disadvantages of travelling in a ship engaged in the
fish-manure, dried-fish, and sea-weed trade. These three very
strongly scented articles speak for themselves without the
need of words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
The Kuriles are the islands which stretch like a row of
beads from the most north-easterly coast of Yezo to the most
southerly point of Kamschatka. They extend from 145° to
158° longitude east of Greenwich, and between 42° and 51°
latitude north.</p>

<p>The archipelago forms part of the Japanese Empire, having
been exchanged by Russia not many years ago for the
southern half of Saghalien Island, then belonging to Japan.
This group of islands is characterised mainly by the great
extent of its volcanic rocks and tertiaries, showing marked
evidence that it is only a continuation of the volcanic
mountain-range forming the backbone of Yezo, and extending
from Yubaridake, in the upper Ishikari province, to Cape
Shiretoko; which volcanic region embraces a large portion of
the Tokachi, Kitami, and Nemuro provinces. In this chain of
islands there are many beautiful volcanic cones, especially in
Kunashiri and Etorofu. Iron, copper, and other metal veins
are found in small quantities in tuffs and andesites, but
more important here, moreover, are the large sulphur accumulations
near and in craters, both extinct and active; as on
Mount Rahush, in Kunashiri, and the Ichibishinai, in Etorofu,
the largest island of the Kuriles. At Pontoo, in Kunashiri,
sulphur bubbles out from the bottom of a volcanic lake, which
is probably an extinct crater.</p>

<p>Beside being rich in minerals, the larger islands of the
Kuriles abound in game; but fishing is the main industry
practised by the sparse population of these rugged regions.
The origin of the word "Kuriles" is not certain, but in all
probability it is from the Russian <i>kuril</i>, smoke, as there are
many active volcanoes in the islands. The more poetical
Japanese call them <i>Chishima</i>, or the "Thousand Islands,"
meaning that they are numberless, and the <i>nonchalant</i> Ainu
of Yezo profess entire ignorance as to their existence, and
only some of the better informed give them the name of
<i>Krafto</i>, by which they really mean Sakhalin. The hairy
people are emphatically poor geographers, and have but little
faculty for locating islands or any other places. In fact, how
could they, having no maps, and no idea even of what a map
is? The Chishima group and the island of Yezo, with all
the smaller islands along and near its coast, when taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
collectively, are called by the Japanese "The Hokkaido."
The nearest of the Kuriles to Yezo is Kunashiri, and south of
it lies the smaller island of Shikotan; then comes Etorofu,
the largest of the group; then Urup; after this a number of
unhabited islets, reefs, and rocks form a barrier separating the
Otkoshk Sea from the Pacific Ocean. Shimushir, at the south-western
end of this barrier, and Onekotan, at the north-eastern,
are the two largest, Shimushir being about thirty
miles in length and four or five wide, and Onekotan about
twenty-five miles long and eight wide. Paromushir (a corruption
of the Ainu words <i>poro</i>, large, and <i>mushiri</i>, island) is the
last island of the group. It has a large reef on its south-east
coast, and is divided by a channel six or seven miles wide
from Cape Lopatka, the most southern point of the Kamschatkan
peninsula. Paromushir is about twice the size of
Urup, and is very mountainous, with rugged cliffs of volcanic
formation, and high picturesque peaks, bearing the same
characteristics as the scenery in Etorofu and Kunashiri, and
also of Kamschatka. I have mentioned this last island, as it
is of some interest, being the most northern point of the
Japanese empire; and also to a certain extent it is interesting
from a geological point of view, but, as far as I know, it is not
inhabited now, and the few Kurilsky Ainu who formerly lived
there migrated further south from one island to another, till
Shimushir<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and Urup<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> afforded them a more hospitable home.
However, they were not to live there for long, for the Japanese
Government, asserting that subjects of the empire who chose
to live so far could not be properly looked after, sent the
small ship on which I was now travelling on a mission with
orders to bring them all down to the formerly deserted island
of Shikotan. The orders had to be obeyed; and reluctantly
setting fire to the huts which they were about to abandon and
never to see again, ninety souls, all that remained of that
nomad tribe of Ainu, were embarked and carried into exile at
Shikotan. The quiet life on the Shikotan rocks little suits the
roaming disposition of the Kurilsky Ainu; and though even
formerly they were rapidly dying out, the rate of mortality
has increased since their exile. Having thus verified the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
that of the "Thousand Islands" of the Chishima group only
three are inhabited, I shall avoid giving a monotonous description
of each bare-looking islet and rock, and I shall land my
readers at Shikotan, on a visit to the Kurilsky Ainu, who are
important to us in connection with the Ainu of Yezo.</p>

<p>It was early in the morning when I looked out of the porthole,
and by a fine moonlight saw that we were close to the
coast. Huge cliffs and peaks, ending in a sharp point, some
converging towards one another, some standing upright
against the whitish cold sky, were reflected in the smooth
water under the lee of the island. The moon, surrounded by
a yellowish halo, shone bright over the rugged scene, giving
delicate bluish tints to all the shadows; while the water,
disturbed and cut by the prow of our craft, rose in gentle
waves, pursuing one another, as if running for a place of refuge
in the mysterious dark shadows of the cliffs. So weird, so
enchanted and wild was the scene, that I jumped out of my
stuffy bunk and went on deck. There I stood, notwithstanding
the cold, gazing at the gigantic overhanging black rocks,
at the precipices, crevices, and natural openings through which
now and then the radiant moon peeped, covering the dark
green water with a long undulating streak of silver dashes.
There I stood, listening to the voices of the waves, which
rippled on the shingle, contemplating this strange and poetic
work of nature. I am certain that if sirens there ever were
in this world, their home must have been among the whimsical
and <i>bizarre</i> rocks of Shikotan Island. The old "tub" on
which I was "ploughing the waves" moved slowly through
this heavenly spectacle of ever-increasing beauty. When the
sun rose, enchantment was added to enchantment. The cold
bluish colour of the rocks became gradually warmer; and, as
the light grew stronger, the tops of the cliffs turned into a mass
of brilliant colours. Nature was waking slowly from her
torpid sleep, and, in the freshness of the morning, a light
breeze, caressing the shore, brought with it the smell of
land.</p>

<p>The captain, a Japanese, informed me that we should soon
enter the harbour of Shikotan, and, pointing to some huge
pillars, said that was the entrance. We drew nearer and
nearer to it, and the nearer we drew the more I became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
convinced that the captain was under an hallucination. I
could only see rock after rock, huge pillar after huge pillar;
but no entrance whatever.</p>

<p>"We are just going in," said the captain, laughing at my
astonishment, and he gave orders to the quartermaster at the
wheel to steer straight for one of the pillars. We were but a
few yards from it when our craft was made to swing rapidly on
her starboard side, and we turned round a gigantic shoulder of
rock, to find ourselves in a narrow channel. One minute later
we were in a pretty circular harbour, surrounded by high
peaks&mdash;in fact, a kind of "fiord." The access to this harbour
is certainly difficult to find, but when you are fairly in, it is
seen to afford a well-sheltered anchorage. It has more the
appearance of a small mountain lake than that of a sea-harbour;
and undoubtedly it is a submerged crater. It is
perfectly circular, and very deep, but not of large capacity.
Directly opposite the entrance, on the shore, is a small narrow
valley, on which is situated the village of the Kurilsky Ainu.
Four men rowed me ashore, and I went to the village.</p>

<p>When the Japanese imported these Kurilsky Ainu to
Shikotan, they allowed them to build their huts in their own
way; but this done, a railing with a gate was erected, closing
the entrance of the valley which overlooks the harbour, thus
preventing the poor wretches from abandoning the island to
resume their migratory habits, and return to their more
northern homes. Inside this gate two rows of huts, exactly
similar to those of the Yezo Ainu, have been constructed by
the exiles. There are sixteen huts altogether, and not a single
one of them is built over a pit. In <a href="#Page_78">Chapter IX</a>, I have fully
explained the characteristics and mode of living, which leaves
no doubt as to these people being proper Ainu, and not pit-dwellers,
as some have asserted; though of course their type
is slightly modified by external conditions&mdash;a common occurrence
in all races. Take a Londoner, a provincial, and a seaman,
and though they be all three Englishmen, one will have
a washed-out look, the other will be healthy and strong, but
not so sturdy, wiry, and weather-beaten as the sailor. The
same natural process is at work with this tribe of Ainu. They
conform their life according to circumstances and places; and
though they possess the same general characteristics as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
rest of the Ainu, in some small details they cannot but differ
from them.</p>

<p>Shikotan was a deserted island previous to these poor
wretches being transplanted there by the Japanese Government.
It does not abound
in game, like Shimushir,
Urup, or Poromushir,
whence they were taken.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 194px;">
<img src="images/illus-126.jpg" width="194" height="199" alt="" title="SHIKOTAN AINU" />
<span class="caption">SHIKOTAN AINU.</span></div>

<p>The story of this tribe
of Ainu is a sad one.
Hunting, sealing, and fishing
were their only aims
in life, their only pastimes,
the only things they lived
for. At Shikotan they
have none of these things.
There is no big game; the
only animal found being a
beautiful species of white
long-tailed fox. There are
no large rivers at Shikotan; there is hardly any vegetation,
and the whole island is nothing but a mass of barren rocks.</p>

<p>The food of the Kurilsky Ainu consisted chiefly of meat of
bear and seals, berries, and eggs of sea-birds. They were a
migratory people, and in their small cranky canoes they often
crossed from one island to another, carrying with them all
their property, consisting of skin garments and fishing and
hunting implements, these latter the same as those employed
by other Ainu. The dress of the men is shaped like a short
tunic, made of sea-birds' skins, with the feathers inside. Some
of the smart ones are trimmed with seal, and they are worn
fastened round the waist with a girdle of sealskin or a belt of
sea-lion hide, often ornamented with molten lead buttons or
Chinese cash. The women's garment is much longer, and
reaches nearly to the feet; it falls loosely, and has long
sleeves covering the hands; it is fastened with a girdle in
bad weather, and the gown is then pulled up to the knee,
showing the long yellow boots. When carrying water or
working this is also done, as it gives greater freedom to the
limbs, making walking and all movement much easier. A red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
yellow, or brightly-coloured handkerchief, of Russian manufacture,
is tied round the neck and another round the back of
the head, and this makes the women look like Italian peasants.
As the gown is worn usually loose it has the identical shape of
a dressing-gown; it is ornamented with yellow feathers of
puffins round the neck and the edge. Both men and women
wear either moccasins, or long boots made of sealskin, with the
fur inside, or else they wear salmon-skin boots, like the Ainu
of Yezo. No woman that I saw at Shikotan had a moustache
tattooed round her lips, or any tattoo marks on her arms. Very
few of them wore earrings, though all had the ears bored for
that purpose, and had worn them. The earrings which they
possessed were mostly strings of coral beads and metal
ornaments of Russian manufacture, which, like the brightly-coloured
handkerchiefs, they had received in bartering with
the crew of a sealing schooner. Since they have been at
Shikotan the men have been presented with old caps and
overcoats, similar to those of the Japanese police. Previous
to this, however, when the Kuriles were under the rigid
Russian <i>régime</i>, the Kurilsky Ainu men were compelled to
trim their hair and beard, which was the first step taken by
the priests of the Coptic Church in Christianising these
nomadic barbarians. When this hair-dressing order was
complied with, as the first link of the chain, the Coptic creed
was enforced on them, and the barbarous Kurilsky Ainu
became well-trimmed orthodox Christians.</p>

<p>At Shikotan, as it is, fishing on a small scale is their main
occupation, praying the next, and Jacko, the chief of the village,
is the high priest. Jacko's predecessor, in fulfilling the
duties of this high post, was a man who had dropped his
Ainu name, and had been baptized as Alexandrovitch. His
house is now occupied by Jacko. It is the first on the right-hand
side when the village is entered from the harbour side,
and it is larger than any of the others; it is built of wood
instead of rushes and reeds. The interior is divided into two
rooms, and in the second are three stands, the middle one
of which has a cross on it. On each of these stands is
a Russian Bible, with images hanging on the page-marks.
Several rough stools and a couple of benches are placed in
rows in front of these stands, and on the walls hang two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
or three Russian religious images. Taken altogether, and
compared with other Ainu huts, Jacko's chapel had quite a
stately appearance.</p>

<p>Just as the Ainu of Yezo have partly acquired the Japanese
language, the Kurilsky Ainu have learned to talk Russian,
besides speaking an Ainu dialect.</p>

<p>On Sundays, or on any day which Jacko thinks is a Sunday,
the chief reads the mass before a congregation of the other fifty-nine
hairy Christians of the Russian Orthodox Church; he does
not spare them a sermon, which sometimes lasts half the day,
and his audience are most attentive and well behaved. None of
them would think of leaving church before service is over; but
one detail in which these hairy Christians are not yet fully
Christianised is, that no collection plate is ever sent round!
The Kurilsky Ainu have undoubtedly accepted the form of
their adopted religion, but I rather doubt whether they have
fallen in with the principle. Their former barbarian ideas
and superstitions are still well rooted in their brain, and each
individual was a curious and enviable combination of a
perfect heathen and a thorough Christian, according to what
suited him or her better at the time being. In other words,
they believed in two diametrically opposed principles, one
of which fitted in with every phase of their life when the other
was deficient.</p>

<p>As many as ninety people, all told, were landed at Shikotan,
but thirty had already succumbed when I visited the island.
A graveyard on a hill on the west side of the village was
indeed a sad reminder of this fact. It will not be long before
all the others will pass away, for consumption and rheumatism
have a great hold on most of the wretches. In ten years from
now, I dare say, not one of the Kurilsky tribe of Ainu will be
left on this earth. It is pitiful that the last remains of these
independent people will end their days secluded and in exile
on the barren rocks of Shikotan.</p>

<p>As it is, they seem to take life easily, and, with a characteristic
proper to all nomadic peoples, they make the best of what
they can get. They are not shy, and they have dropped the
formalities and grand salutations of other Ainu. They are,
however, as dirty, especially in their homes. The women dress
their hair in small tresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
The children wear long gowns similar to those of the
women, and one or two of the children I saw had very fair
hair. As will be seen by the illustrations, some of the men
and women possess good features, more resembling those of
European races than those of Mongolian type. They are
gentle and quiet, like all other Ainu. They are submissive,
and resigned to their sad fate.</p>

<p>The island of Skikotan is almost circular in shape, and
it has one or two small anchorages on its north coast. I
judged its diameter to be about twelve or thirteen miles.
Etorofu and Kunashiri, though much larger in size, are of less
interest to us in connection with the Ainu, as most of that race
found there migrate from Yezo during the fishing season;
therefore, nothing is to be added about them.</p>

<p>Etorofu is a long, narrow, but irregular island, over one
hundred miles in length, and varying in breadth from five or
six to twenty miles. It is very mountainous, and has some
bold, rugged scenery, owing to its volcanic formation.
Etorofu is by far the largest island of the Kurile group, and it
possesses many safe anchorages, especially on its north-west
coast, where several mountainous capes branch off the narrow
strip of land, and afford small ships a fairly safe harbourage
from west and south-westerly winds. Unfortunately, however,
they are open to northerly and north-east gales, during
the prevalence of which, should a ship happen to be cruising
about in those latitudes, she would have to run for a shelter
to the south-east coast. The south-east coast is not peopled,
with the exception of a very few huts near Moyorotake, or
"Bear Bay," at its most south-eastern point. A better shelter,
however, is to be found in the bay, nearly in the middle of the
island, on the shores of which are a few huts at Onembets and
Imotsuto. Most of the coast is deserted, and the south-east
portion is very rocky, huge cliffs, with high richly-coloured
mountains in the background, ending like an impassable wall
into the sea. Where the island is narrower there are some
low terraces with scrub bamboo and stunted trees. Larch
is found in Etorofu, while it is seldom found in Yezo.
Heather-like plants are also indigenous in Etorofu, and
cranberry bushes are frequent near the coast. From Betoya or
Bettobu Bay down to its most south-western point Etorofu is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
all mountainous, with the exception of a small valley near
Rubets. It is along the banks of the Bettobu River, in that
small valley and on those terraces, that the numerous pits of
the Koro-pok-kuru are found, and also at Rupets, further
south on the same coast. This, however, I have already
explained in connection with the pit-dwellers. The two
small fishing-stations above mentioned are respectively under
the lee of the headlands ending in Cape Ikahasonets and
Notoro Cape. On the first headland the mountain of Tsiriju
rises to a great altitude. The largest fishing-station is at
Shana, on the western side of this headland, and further north,
besides Bettobu, is the small station of Shibets. South-west
of Shana one finds Rubets, Furubets, Oitoi, and Naibo, the
latter in the bay of the same name. There are five lakes in
Etorofu, two of which are between Shana and Bettobu, one
near Rubets, the other close to Naibo; the fifth is a very
small one, fifteen or sixteen miles north-east of Bettobu. The
country has a rugged look, and in some places, as near Rubets,
where the volcanic mountain masses leave space for low
terraces the scrub-bamboo is very thick, as in Yezo, and
small and stunted trees form the chief vegetation. Larch is
more common on the north-west coast than on the south-east.
Good timber is rather scarce in Etorofu, but a fair quantity of
it is to be found inland, and also at the south-western portion
of the island about Naipo.</p>

<p>Accumulations of sulphur are found at Ichibishinai, and
there is an active volcano south-east of Bettobu, besides the
beautiful volcanic cone of Atzosa, three or four thousand feet
above sea-level. All this volcanic mountain mass, with its
warmly-tinted peaks, bears the characteristics of the central
portion of Yezo; and there seems to be little doubt that all
this row of islands, with the frequent submerged craters and
volcanic cones, is nothing but the continuation of the volcanic
zone in Yezo. The main resource of Etorofu is the fishing.
Four different kinds of salmon and salmon-trout are found, one
similar to the salmon common in Yezo, the others somewhat
differently marked. Salmon is extremely plentiful, and in July
and August enormous catches are made, especially at the
mouths of the rivers, where the fish are closely packed
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
The Pico Strait, between Etorofu and Kunashiri, is about
fourteen miles wide, and a strong current from the Okhotsk
Sea passes through it, causing the sea to break in heavy tide-rips
and overfalls similar to those observed in the La Perouse
Strait, between Yezo and Sakhalin. Similar tide-rips are
observed also in the channel between Etorofu and Urup, but,
being much wider (about twenty-four miles), they seem there
less formidable.</p>

<p>Kunashiri is the next largest island in the Kuriles after
Etorofu. It is about sixty-five miles long, and very narrow;
varying from three to eight miles in width. The north-east
portion is somewhat wider, and extremely mountainous. The
highest peak of this mountain range is the Tcha-Tcha-Nobori
(the old-old-mountain), which is said to be about seven
thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea. From
this volcano starts a chain of hills&mdash;some pyramidal in form,
others somewhat rounder at the top&mdash;which forms the backbone
of the island. Two more active volcanoes besides the Tcha-Tcha
are on the south-west portion of Kunashiri, but they do
not rise to a very great altitude. On Horanaho or Rausu
volcano sulphur accumulations are found, and at Pontoo (small
lake) sulphur bubbles out from the lake bottom, and seems to
be worked with profit. The Tcha-Tcha-Nobori is curiously
shaped. It is like a large cone cut about half-way up in
a section, to which a smaller cone has been attached, leaving
a wide ring right round. It is extremely picturesque, and a
worthy finish to the strange outline of Kunashiri Island.</p>

<p>Vegetation and products are the same as in Etorofu.
Salmon is plentiful, and a few fishing-stations are spread out
here and there at long intervals on the coast. As in Etorofu,
the population of Kunashiri migrates there from Yezo during
the fishing season, and leaves the island almost deserted in
winter. The strait separating it from Yezo is only ten or
twelve miles wide. Bears and foxes are said to be very
numerous in all the larger islands of the Kuriles, and seals are
captured in large quantities during the winter months, more
especially in the islands nearer Kamschatka. Small game,
as ducks, snipes, and sandpipers, is abundant. Besides the
ruggedness and strange aspect of its numerous volcanic peaks,
the bareness and the loneliness of the coast, there is nothing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the Kurile group to entice the sightseer and the pleasure-seeker
to a cruise among the islands. The geologist and
zoologist, however, would find in the Kuriles a very rough but
very interesting field for their investigations, and a "good
shot," who does not mind a self-sacrificing and lonely life,
would find some good sport among the bears, especially in
Kunashiri and Etorofu.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="small">On the East and North-East Coast&mdash;From Nemuro to Shari-Mombets.</span></h2>


<p>I did not remain long at Nemuro after my return from the
Kuriles; in fact, I remained only a few hours, and again my
baggage was lashed to the pack-saddle, again I was perched
on the top of this instrument of torture, and soon was rapidly
moving north towards the inhospitable coast of the Okhotsk
Sea.</p>

<p>The first few days of the lonely life of a peripatetic Robinson
Crusoe are unmistakably disagreeable, but after that initiation
there is no doubt that it is a fascinating life. I was more than
glad when the gay Nemuro was out of sight, and the noise and
rumble of semi-civilisation out of hearing. The editor and
seven gentlemen of Nemuro accompanied me for a few miles&mdash;then
I was left to myself and my own resources. Crossing
the Onnetto River, the outlet of a large lagoon of the same
name, I passed through Nishibets and then Bitskai, where in
former days the Japanese had established a salmon-canning
factory, which proved a failure, owing to the incapacity of its
directors and workmen. Salmon is very abundant in the
Nishibets River, and a well-managed canning factory would
be a great success. About ten or eleven miles north of Bitskai
a peculiar peninsula stretches out from north-east to south-west,
which affords a shelter for small junks from northerly
winds. It is called Noshike, and is not more than a few feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
above the sea-level. The soil all along is very marshy, and
the numerous little rivulets and rivers are extremely troublesome
to cross. My pony was continually sinking into and
struggling out of mud-holes, into which it had fallen when
wading across these small watercourses, sometimes not more
than a few feet wide. I pushed on as far as Shimbets, where
there are only a shed and a couple of Ainu huts inhabited by
half-castes. I had to put up here for the night, and by the
light of a wick burning in a large oyster-shell filled with fish-oil
I wrote a few notes in my diary. The fleas in that house
were something appalling. The next morning I had some
fun with a wild pony, which I received in exchange for the
tired animal I had brought.</p>

<p>"Nobody can get on him," said the Ainu half-caste, "but if
you think you can ride him he will go like the wind."</p>

<p>It took all hands in the small village to get the pack-saddle
and baggage on to his back, and after we had tied him to a
post and lashed his fore legs together I mounted. By instalments
he was untied, let loose, and then afforded us some real
fun. He revolved, bucked, kicked, stood on his hind legs, and
did his very best to bite my legs and knock me off the saddle.
A small fence was kicked and smashed into a thousand bits,
and he even attempted to enter the huts&mdash;anything to get rid
of his rider; but he did not succeed. His next trick was to
plunge into the river close by, and when he reached the middle
to shake himself violently. He then came out on the other
side, and, turning his head, saw as well as felt that I was still
on his back; then he neighed as if in great distress, and
bolted. He galloped along the small track, and really did go
"like the wind." As a punishment I made him keep up the
pace even when he was tired of his contumacy, and in less
than no time I reached Shibets, ten miles distant from where
I had started.</p>

<p>Shibets is a village of one hundred Japanese houses and
twenty Ainu huts. The Ainu here have almost altogether
adopted Japanese clothes, as well as something of the Japanese
style of living. The river which goes by the same name is
notable for the quantity and good quality of salmon caught in
it, and it is the best salmon-fishing river on the north-east
coast of Yezo. Herrings are also abundant, but not to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
same extent as on the south-east coast. A peculiarity of the
river is that before entering the sea it turns sharply south and
runs along a bank of sand and mud, which is growing larger
every year, which shows that a current from the Okhotsk Sea
must travel down in that direction through the strait between
Kunashiri and Yezo. The same peculiarity is noticeable in
nearly all the rivers of the north-east coast.</p>

<p>From Shibets to Wembets the track is fairly even, but from
Wembets round Cape Shiretoko it is in many places impassable
even on foot. The Peninsula, ending in Cape Shiretoko,
is a mass of high volcanic mountains towards the interior,
while scabrous cliffs and huge rocks fringe the line of coast.
However, from Shibets there is a small mountain track inland
which brings the traveller across to the north-east coast near
Shari. The track was through beautiful forests of pine trees,
oak, birch, and elm, and during the first few miles it is on
almost level ground. After that, hill after hill is ascended and
descended, and one goes ever onwards at a higher altitude,
until Rubets, a small shed, is reached. From here the track
follows a zig-zag direction till it reaches the summit of the
mountain range, and one then begins to descend on the other
side. From the summit there is a lovely view of beautiful
blue mountains in the distant west, one of which is called
Oakan, and the other Moyokan. The mountainous part of
the track from Igiani, three miles from Shibets, as far as
the north-east coast, reminded me much of the scenery in
Switzerland, with its rapid and limpid fresh-water rivers,
thickly-wooded country, and green grass, which last was replaced
here by an undergrowth of scrub bamboo. When I
went across this mountain pass the rain was pouring in
torrents, and the road, such as it was, being very slippery and
heavy, I only reached the north-east coast at dark. The
moon would not rise till late, there were heavy black clouds,
and I was more than puzzled how to find my way.</p>

<p>To add to my bad luck, my pony this time was a sorry
beast, with his back a mass of sores. I was simply drenched
with the rain that never ceased. Now and then, by the blinding
flash of lightning, I could see a long stretch of sand and a
line of sand-hills; I could also see the reeds bending low under
the squalls, and then everything was darkness again. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
leading my tired beast, and dragging him along as well
as I could. Every few yards the wretched creature collapsed,
and it took a lot of petting, caressing, encouraging and
beating to make him get up again. I had ridden and
walked about fourteen hours in the rain, and was nearly
frozen to death.</p>

<p>Since I had got out of the forest a bitterly cold north wind
chilled me through and through, and added the last touch to
my weariness and discomfort. Again the pony fell, and all
my efforts to make him get up were useless. The storm, if
anything, seemed to increase in violence, while my own
strength was decreasing every minute. I lay down by the
side of the pony, trying to warm myself by his heat, and,
shivering and rattling my teeth together, I tried to go to
sleep.</p>

<p>A couple of hours were spent in this way, and when the
moon rose I could see a little clearer. I climbed with hands
and feet on to the sand-hills, and I fancied I saw some dark
spots in the distance. Could they be Shari? First one end
of my whip, then the other, was reduced into pulp on my
pony's back, and with a great effort he again stood on all four
legs. I had to support the wretch all the way, as you would a
drunken man, and we went at the rate of less than a mile an
hour. The spots grew bigger and bigger, and took the shape
of huts.</p>

<p>"Hem, hem, hem, hem!" I called out at the first hut, while
three or four dogs barked furiously and went for my legs.
"Will you let a stranger sleep here to-night?"</p>

<p>"This is no house for strangers; go elsewhere!" answered
a drowsy hoarse voice from inside.</p>

<p>"May you be kept&mdash;hot!" said I, in pure Ainu fashion,
though in my heart I attached quite a different meaning to
the sentence from that which the hairy people give it; and
wearily I pulled myself together and passed on.</p>

<p>A shadow crept out of one of the huts, and thanks to that
shadow I found a shelter for the night. There are fifty Ainu huts
at Shari, and ten Japanese, with an Ainu population of about
one hundred souls. The Ainu here have adopted Japanese
clothes, and many of them eat Japanese food when they can
get it. The Ainu women of Shari are exceedingly pretty, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
they do not tattoo the long moustache across their faces, like
other Ainu. Some of them have a small semicircular tattoo
on the upper lip, which is not very displeasing to the eye;
and in some cases is even becoming. The girls have also
given up tattooing their arms. The men are much taller than
the Ainu men of other regions, and they seem to be rather ill-natured.
Japanese blood can be detected in many of them,
and that may account for it. While the women are prettier,
the men have repulsive faces, possessing all the characteristics
of purely criminal types.</p>

<p>One young fellow who sat for me was the very image of
Robespierre in his worst moments, and an old man who sat
for me afterwards would, according to Phrenology, prove to
be a murderer of the first water. This gentleman was a
troublesome sitter, and excelled in making the most awful
faces, which were accompanied by sounds imitating those of
wild beasts. The Shari Ainu build their storehouses with
cylindrical roofs, similar to those of their brethren on the
Kutcharo Lake.</p>

<p>After the heavy storm of the previous night the weather
cleared up for the rest of the day, and the sunset, reflected in
the limpid waters of the river, was simply magnificent. On
the other side, sheltered by the sand-hills, were a few Ainu
huts standing out against the brilliant red and yellow sky, and
here and there a large fish jumped out of the water, leaving
circle after circle of concentric rings to break for the moment
the reflection in the water.</p>

<p>From Shari to Abashiri the road is for some distance
among trees, mostly fir and spruce, and then the Tobuts Lake
is reached, half of which is a mere marsh. It is picturesquely
situated, and I followed its borders for about three miles,
having the sea on one side, the lake on the other. The track
was easy and mostly on sand. At the outlet of the lake into
the sea is the Ainu village of Tobuts, access to which is to be
had only by boat, as the river is extremely deep, and its
current very swift.</p>

<p>In the proximity of Tobuts another and smaller lake, the
Opoto, with its short and winding estuary, is on the left of the
traveller, while a long way ahead the Abashiri rocks stand
high on the horizon. A few Ainu huts are scattered along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
coast, and some of them have peculiarly shaped storehouses.
They are small, built entirely of wood, and roofed with
shingles. Some have two floors, and in this case, though built
on piles, the first floor is only a few inches above the ground.
The "mat" was supplanted by a wooden door at the entrance
of the storehouse.</p>

<p>The Abashiri cliffs are grand, and from a distance have all
the appearance of, though they are not in reality, basaltic rocks.
They are scarred, riven, and fractured in all directions, as if
by excessive heat. The upper portion of the cliffs is of a
beautiful grey-whitish colour, blending into yellow and red at
their warm brown bases. The small cylindrical islet which I
give in the illustration is on the north side of this cliff, and
is of the same volcanic formation. It has certain traces of
sulphur as a further evidence of its origin. Flocks of sea-gulls,
penguins, and cormorants have chosen this island for their
abode.</p>

<p>Abashiri is the only place on the north-east coast which may
eventually be of some importance, as it has a fair anchorage
for small craft under the lee of the islet and outstretching
cliff. No other place on the north-east coast possesses such
an advantage. On the Shiretoko Peninsula sulphur accumulations
are found at Itashibeoni; but, unfortunately, the want
of a safe harbour, the ruggedness of the coast, and the lack
of drinkable water in the vicinity, are all facts which make it
improbable that it could be worked with profit for some
years to come. The Ainu at Abashiri are repulsive creatures,
especially the men, and have more the appearance of wild
beasts than human beings. Their faces are almost square,
the mouth large, with narrow lips, the ends of which converge
towards the ears. The nose is short and stumpy, they have
very heavy eyebrows, and the eyes are almost lost under
the shadow of their projecting forehead.</p>

<p>Ponies are scarce and bad along this coast, and the further
north one goes the more difficult the travelling becomes; the
huts are rarer; the human beings more uncouth and solitary.
The north-east coast is a region of swamps, lagoons, and
quicksand rivers.</p>

<p>Not far inland from Abashiri there is a large lagoon, the
Abashiri-ko; then, a few miles further north, another as large&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Notoro-ko. The Abashiri Lake finds an outlet in a river
which goes by the same name of, and falls into the pretty Bay
of Abashiri; but the Notoro-ko, as well as the larger lagoon
of Saruma-ko, which one comes upon after having passed the
two villages of Tukoro and Tobuts, open directly into the sea.
The strong current and the tide often block the entrance of
these lagoons, and the rising water finds an outlet in a
different spot. These lagoons are separated from the sea by a
long and narrow strip of sand-hill; and crossing the outlet
always involves great danger if the unwary traveller does not
choose the right moment. The tide creating a great inequality
of level between the sea and the lake, it follows that at the
opening of the lagoon the water either throws itself from the
sea into the lagoon, or <i>vice versâ</i>, according to the ebb or flow,
and makes a kind of whirlpool. The Saruma Lake being
much larger than any of the others, while its mouth is much
smaller, and underlaid with quicksands, the danger is even
greater, and the safest way is always to get across in a boat at
slack water. The Saruma Lake is about fifteen miles in
length and from two to three miles wide. Its water is salt,
and large oyster-banks are found in it. It is also a favourite
resort for seal and mallard. In winter they can be killed in
great numbers, but in the warmer months they are shy, and
very difficult to approach. The south-western shore of the lake
is thickly wooded, and has as a background a long range of
high mountains with smaller mountains in front of it.</p>

<span class="caption">AN AINU BELLE.</span></div>

<p>At Tobuts, a small village of a few huts, situated at the
mouth of the Saruma lagoon, I halted for the night. There
was a change in my diet that day, and I was entertained, or
rather I entertained myself, to an oyster supper. They were
enormous oysters, similar to those found at Akkeshi, but not
very palatable. However, I was in luck that day, and not only
did I have this oyster supper, but I actually was the hero of
a tender little idyll. In this country surprises never come
alone, and while I was sketching in the twilight to pass away
the time, a tall slim figure of a girl came out of one of the
huts. She had slipped her arms out of her robe, leaving the
latter to hang from the girdle, and her breasts, arms, and
the lower half of her legs were uncovered. She was pretty
and quaint with her tattooed arms and a semicircular black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
spot on her upper lip. She walked a few steps forward, and
when she saw me she stopped. She looked at me and I
looked at her. Hers, with
her soft eyes, was one of
those looks which a man
feels right through his body,
notwithstanding all the self-control
he may possess.
There she stood, a graceful
silhouette, with a bucket
made of tree-bark in one
hand and a vine-tree rope
in the other, her supple
figure almost motionless,
and her eyes fixed on me.
She was the most lovely
Ainu girl I had ever come
across, and not nearly so
hairy as most of them.
Indeed, in that soft twilight,
and her wavy long hair
blown by the fresh breeze,
she was a perfect dream.</p>

<p>"Wakka!" ("Water!")
cried an angry old voice
from inside the hut, interrupting
the beginning of
our romance, and she sadly
went to the brook, filled her
bucket with water, and took it into the hut. It was only
a few seconds before she reappeared, and came closer, and
I finished the sketch somewhat hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Let me see the tattoo on your arm," I asked her, and to
my surprise the pretty maid took my hand in both her own,
gave me one of those looks that I shall never forget, and her
head fell on my shoulder. She clutched my hand tightly, and
pressed it to her chest, and a force stronger than myself
brought her and myself to the neighbouring forest. There we
wandered and wandered till it grew very dark; we sat down,
we chattered, we made love to each other; then we returned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
I would not have mentioned this small episode if her ways of
flirting had not been so extraordinary and funny. Loving and
biting went together with her. She could not do the one
without doing the other. As we sat on a stone in the semi-darkness
she began by gently biting my fingers, without
hurting me, as affectionate dogs often do to their masters; she
then bit my arm, then my shoulder, and when she had worked
herself up into a passion she put her arms round my neck
and bit my cheeks. It was undoubtedly a curious way of
making love, and when I had been bitten all over, and was
pretty tired of the new sensation, we retired to our respective
homes.</p>

<p>In the evening, as I was writing my diary by the light of
one of the oyster-shell primitive lamps, somebody noiselessly
crept by my side. I turned my head round. It was she!
She grew more and more sentimental as it grew later, and she
bestowed on me caresses and bites in profusion. Kissing,
apparently, was an unknown art to her. The old woman, in
whose house I was, slept soundly all through this, as old
women generally do on such occasions. By the mysterious
light of the dying wick, casting heavy shadows, which marked
her features strongly, with her jet-black wild hair fading away
into the black background, with her passionate eyes, and her
round, statue-like arms, the girl was more like a strange fairy
than a human being.</p>

<p>I sketched her twice in pencil, and the wick&mdash;that wretched
wick!&mdash;grew feeble, and, for the lack of oil, began to dwindle
away. I persuaded her to return to her hut, and with a few
"bites" my hairy maid and I parted.</p>

<p>The morning came, and I was up early. In the vicinity
of the huts I found three Koro-pok-kuru pits similar to those
we have already seen; and previous to arriving at Tobuts I
also found a fort belonging to the pre-Ainu race. From
Tobuts, continuing my journey north, on the stretch of
sand between the water of the sea and that of the Saruma
lake the travelling was fairly easy but monotonous. The
long chain of mountains on the other side of the lake was
magnificent in the morning light. For twenty-two miles
this went on; then I had to cross the Yubets River in the picturesque
spot where its waters divide before again uniting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
close to the sea. North of this river there are three more
lagoons&mdash;the Komuki, the Shibumotzunai, and the Yassuchi,
the first two of which have direct estuaries into the sea,
generally blocked by drift-sand, and both are as dangerous as
the Saruma lagoon when the water unexpectedly overflows.
Owing to the heavy rains on the mountains the level of the
lakes had risen considerably when I went through, and crossing
the mouth of the first in a flat-bottomed boat, I was nearly
swamped. The Ainu who was ferrying me across did not
lose his presence of mind, and after a long struggle and
violent efforts we reached the opposite shore. Yubets is a
village of eighteen Ainu and three Japanese huts. The
Ainu along these shores are extremely hairy, and some of
them have red beards, while others are bald. Near some of
their huts you may see cages where foxes and eagles are kept
in captivity.</p>

<p>The women, all the way to Soya Cape, the most northern
point of Yezo, have given up tattooing a long moustache
and their arms. A small semicircular spot, similar to the
tattoo of the Shari women, is nevertheless not uncommon.
Bears, yellow and black, again are said to be in huge
quantities on the thickly-wooded mountains at the back of
the Saruma and other lagoons.</p>

<p>The coast is most desolate-looking. One may travel mile
after mile without seeing a hut or meeting a single human
being. Now and then, when I came to a lonely fisherman's
hut, I was civilly treated; and, riding from morn till night, I
reached Shari Mombets, where there are forty Ainu huts and
about the same number of Japanese fishermen's shanties. It
has a small anchorage for small junks only; but, unfortunately,
it is not well protected, as the reef of rocks which runs in a
north-east direction does not extend far out to sea. I was
roughly treated here at first, for some Russian convicts, who
had escaped from Sakhalin in an open boat, had been drifted
by the current down this coast, and previously to my arrival
had landed in the vicinity of this village. They were half
starved, and could not speak a word of the language. They
had no money and no clothes, and none of the natives seemed
willing to help them in any way. Now that the long-wished-for
freedom was obtained after years of servitude and chains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the four brave men, who had suffered agonies for days, and
had almost miraculously escaped death in the treacherous
currents of the Otkoshk Sea, were certainly not to be
outwitted by a handful of hard-hearted Japanese or by a
pack of hairy Ainu. They begged for food and could not
obtain it, so they stole it, and ill-treated some of the natives
who interfered. They then disappeared towards the south.
When I put in an appearance, all alone and almost in rags,
leading and dragging my tired pony, it is not astonishing
that the first thing that struck them was that I must be
another escaped Russian, "or bad man from Krafto,"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as the
Ainu called me.</p>

<p>The reception I received was pretty stormy; but when I
understood what the matter was which caused the rioting,
I set their minds at rest, and, speaking in their own
language, told them that the "bad men of Krafto" were
my enemies as well as theirs, and that, should I find
them, I would punish them. Not only that, but, to make
them perfectly at ease, I gave them some little present of
money, which turned them at once into friends. As to
the Russian convicts, there was no possibility of my finding
them, for they were travelling towards the south from this
point, and I was moving towards the north, so I was
perfectly safe in passing myself off as a kind of supreme
judge.</p>

<p>Shari Mombets is a miserable place. In the house where I
put up I was received by a young man, but the owner of the
house did not show himself. The next morning, however, as
I gave much more money than they expected, the landlord
was brought to my room to thank me. The poor man
suffered from elephantiasis&mdash;the wretched disease by which
the head and all the limbs of the body assume gigantic
proportions. His head was swollen to more than twice its
normal size, and had lost its shape; his body was piteously
deformed and inflated, his eyes nearly buried in flesh. The
weight of his head was such that the cervical vertebræ were
scarcely strong enough to support it erect; and when he
bowed down in Japanese fashion to thank me and bid me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
good-bye, I had to run to his help, for he could not get
up again. Poor man! And when we reflect that in more
civilised countries many people think themselves very ill and
suffering when they have a pimple on their nose, or a cold in
their head!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="small">Along the Lagoons of the North-east Coast&mdash;From Shari Mombets to
Poronai.</span></h2>


<p>I proceeded north. The Ainu scattered here and there on
the coast seemed to be hairier and uglier than any of their
inland brethren. Two or three women had already put on
their winter fur garments, as the cold weather had begun; and
they looked extremely picturesque in them. Most of the
huts were uninhabited, and had been abandoned by their
owners. The sky was whitish and cold, and here and there
along the beach some huge bones of whales had been washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
on shore by the tide. Some distance off an outcast horse was
attacked by thousands of famished crows. It is not an
uncommon occurrence in Yezo. The black scavengers generally
attack very young animals, and, flying on the pony's
head, peck out its eyes. The pony, frightened, and driven
mad by pain, bolts, and in his blind and reckless race either
falls down a precipice and is killed outright, or else is driven
to the coast by these daring wretches, which continue to peck
at him with cruel and ceaseless avidity. There, with its way
barred by the waves, tortured to death, and neighing
desperately, the helpless beast succumbs, and affords the
hungry birds a good meal, while hundreds gathered thick on
the body, peck the poor brute to death. Thousands of others
sit screaming in long rows round the scene of the fight,
attentively watching for the final result, when they too can
join in, and experience the joys of sated hunger. Nature can
indeed be cruel.</p>

<p>I stopped at a hut. My host was decidedly peculiar. For
convenience we shall call him Omangus, which only means a
"gone man," or a lunatic. I had heard of him further south,
and I was anxious to make his acquaintance. I had not been
five minutes in his hut before I perceived that he really was a
lunatic. His head was of an abnormally large size; his skull
was well developed at the back, with those prominent bumps
behind the ears which show great love of eating. His
forehead was high, and very slanting; the upper part was
wider than near the eyebrows, which were so thick and bushy
as nearly to cover the eyes. His nose, with its large nostrils,
was stumpy and covered with hair, while his enormous
projecting eyes were restless and fierce. His luxuriant
moustache and beard matched the thick crop of long black
hair which covered his whole body. His legs were short,
wiry, with stiff and swollen joints, probably owing to rheumatism.
His arms were very long, and his toes were also
abnormally long. Altogether he had the appearance of a
large orang-outang more than that of a human being. All
his movements resembled those of a wild beast, and now
and then, when pleased or dissatisfied, he would groan in
a way not dissimilar to the growling of a bear. In fact, he
was labouring under the belief that he was a wild beast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
some sort, and apparently he regarded himself as a "bruin."
I never heard him speak or utter words, but whether he was
actually dumb or not I was not able to ascertain, as every
time I tried to examine his mouth he attempted to bite
me. His biting, however, was of a different nature from that
of the sweet girl on the Saruma shores, and when he did bite
he bit well. One day in a struggle I came off nearly minus
two joints of the third finger of my right hand.</p>

<p>I several times attempted to take measurements of his
skull and bones, but with no success. Once, as I had got
hold of him and was feeling the "bumps" on his skull, he
managed to disentangle himself, and grabbed me by the hair,
which led to a conflict, and caused me a "très mauvais quart
d'heure." We fought desperately, and I was thoroughly
"licked"; not, however, before having found out that he had
no bump of sensitiveness and none of philoprogenitiveness.
He was pleased with his victory, and the hostilities ended.
He hopped away cautiously, and I saw him climb on his
hands and feet over the cliff near his hut, where he
disappeared.</p>

<p>Some hours later I saw the monomaniac stealthily creeping
back among the rocks. I was some way from the hut, in a
place where he could not see me. He came slowly forward,
watching the hut suspiciously, as he evidently thought I was
still inside. When he got near he stopped to pick up a
large stone, and with it in his right hand he sneaked along
towards the hut. He listened, and crept in. I followed
immediately after. He was furious when I entered, and tried
to escape, but I barred his way. He retreated into a corner,
crouched down groaning, and showed signs of impatience.
I could see that he was frightened, and I went to him and
endeavoured to soothe him; not without success, for he
became quieter, and I once more noticed the great power that
a stronger will can exercise over a weaker one. As long as
I was staring at him he never dared to move, and I could
"will" him to do almost anything I wanted by thinking hard
that he should do it; but when once I turned my eyes away
I had no more control over him.</p>

<p>This is just what happened that day. Thinking that he
would keep quiet for some minutes, I got out my palette and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
brushes in order to take his likeness. I had till then relied on
my power of "willing" people, when my host, seizing the
opportunity of my turning my head away for one moment,
grabbed the stone which he had picked up, and threw it with
great force at me. I was hit in the ribs, and was hurt sufficiently
to lose my temper. I went for him, and gave him a
sound thrashing, which sometimes has more effect than all the
"willing" in the world. He became docile after that, and I
took him outside and forced him to squat down.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;">
<img src="images/illus-148.jpg" width="510" height="600" alt="MY HOST, THE MADMAN" />
<span class="caption">MY HOST, THE MADMAN.</span></div>

<p>He was restless while I was painting him, and hundreds of
half-starved crows, which seemed to be on good terms with
my sitter, gathered round him, chatting in their incomprehensible
and noisy language. Some of them even flew on to
his back and shoulders, and he touched them without their
flying away.</p>

<p>I was astounded at the familiarity which existed between
the madman and the birds. They seemed to understand each
other, and had I only been sufficiently imaginative I might have
asserted that I even saw them kissing him. Unfortunately,
when the first astonishment was over I understood the reason
of the affection on the part of the scavengers, and the whole
mystery was unveiled to me. Like all mysteries, the apparently
extraordinary friendship between the madman and the
black birds turned out to be a plain bit of literal prose, and, I
must add, a very disgusting bit. The maniac was covered with
vermin, and the affectionate kisses of the crows were not
kisses of love or sympathy, but only mouthfuls of parasites,
which they found among the thick hair of his body.</p>

<p>Two or three times the maniac crawled up to me, and
seemed anxious to touch the colours on my palette, and also
to put his fingers on the sketch. He saw that he gained
nothing by being a foe, so he became a friend. He even
became a great friend when I presented him with a shiny
silver coin.</p>

<p>Though Omangus was undoubtedly insane, he was a very
practical person. As will be seen by the illustration, his attire
was simple, and no allowance was made for pockets. He
looked at the coin, turned it over in his hands several times,
and grinned; then he placed it in his mouth for safe keeping.
His mouth was apparently his purse. As I saw that he was
fond of silver coins, I gave him one or two more, and all of
them were religiously kept in the same natural pocket, except
at night, when he hid them under a large stone. At sunrise
they were collected again and placed back under his
tongue or in one of his cheeks.</p>

<p>I cannot say that my host was by any means brilliant, but,
like most lunatics, he was a good soul apart from his little
peculiarities. It was unfortunate that he had lost the power
of speech, or I might have learnt some strange things from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Omangus was generally restless at night, and while asleep
he seemed to suffer from awful nightmares. Most Ainu as
a rule do not. One morning at dawn, as the first rays of
light penetrated the hut, I watched him. He had been
groaning frightfully all night, and I had not been able to
sleep. He was lying flat on his back breathing heavily, and
now and then he had a kind of spasm, during which he
ground his teeth together with violence. It was during these
spasms, or nervous contractions, that he groaned most fiercely.
As he was so stretched I noticed how extraordinarily long his
femur was compared to his tibia. I gently placed my hand
over his heart, and found it was beating rapidly and irregularly.
His forehead also was feverish and abnormally warm. He did
not wake up, but as soon as the nervous strain was over he fell
into a lethargic state. He appeared to have lost all strength,
and it took me some time to awake him; but he finally opened
his eyes, and, drowsily getting up, yawned to his heart's
content, and went to fetch the hidden coins.</p>

<p>The more I saw of Omangus, the more he puzzled me.
His faculties were defective; still, he seemed to possess a
fairly good memory. If not, how could he remember the
concealed treasure? Although he was not able to form ideas
of his own, he could retain those which he had grasped. His
hearing was extremely acute, and his inability to speak must
have undoubtedly been caused by paralysis of the tongue
and vocal organs. Several times he made violent attempts to
utter words, which he would not have done had he been
born dumb.</p>

<p>After the second day of my pleasant stay in Omangus' ten
feet square sea-side residence my host became more genial
and even affectionate. Instead of constantly running away
from me he sat opposite me, attentively watching all my movements;
and if I happened to be whistling, he slowly crept
nearer, grinning with delight. Occasionally he crouched himself
by my side, even resting against me. I did not approve
of the latter proof of affection, not so much for his own sake
as on account of the "large company" which he carried with
him; but I had to put up with it until I found a counter-action
in loud singing, which frightened him away.</p>

<p>Omangus had a quantity of last year's salmon, which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
dried in the sun, and which was now hanging from the roof of
the little hut. The first day or two of my stay there I had
but little to eat, owing to his belligerent behaviour. He
rebelled every time that I attempted to touch his provisions,
and what I had to eat was generally appropriated while my
host was out. Afterwards, however, he became generous, and
gave me more than I wanted. He took good care to draw
the three coins out of his mouth while he was eating, but
once, during a nervous fit, to which he was often subject,
he swallowed one of them.</p>

<p>One morning, weary of my lunatic friend's company, I
packed all my traps and went to fetch my pony. Omangus
seemed aghast, suspecting that I was about to leave. He
was restless, and followed me, moaning, from the hut to the
pony and back, and, with a forlorn look in his eyes, watched
me bring the baggage outside and lash it to the pack-saddle.
I gave him a couple more silver coins, which I thought would
make him happy; but he dropped them in the sand. I bade
good-bye to him and left; and there poor Omangus stood
motionless, gazing at me until the winding shore took me
round the cliff. He was out of sight for some minutes, but he
soon reappeared on the summit of the cliff itself, on to which
he rapidly climbed, and from this point of vantage he could
see the coast for several miles. There standing, a black
figure against the rising sun, the hairy Ainu became smaller
and smaller as I moved away from him, until nothing but a
black spot could be seen against the sky; then even that spot
disappeared. It was the last I saw of my host the madman.</p>

<p>The rivers were troublesome all along this part of my
journey, and as most of them had quicksands, the safest plan
was to cross them in a boat, when this was obtainable. However,
as I went further north the boats became scarce and
more scarce, and the small villages, few and very far between.
I seldom came across a human being with whom I could
exchange a word, and the constant solitude induced in me the
bad habit of talking to myself, to animals, or to inanimate
objects. My unfortunate pony was often lectured on different
subjects, and the millions of seagulls and penguins all along
the coast were asked questions of all sorts, which, however,
they invariably left unanswered. It was strange to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
myriads of birds stretched in two or three lines along the
shore. Like the "beasts which roamed over the plains" in
Alexander Selkirk's lament, they had seen so few human
beings as to be indifferent to me and my pony, and I could
walk among them without disturbing them or causing them to
fly away. The penguins were my greatest source of amusement,
with their fat bodies and their funny way of lifting up
one leg as I was approaching, in order to get enough spring
to raise themselves from the ground had I attempted to
capture them. I was soliloquising, according to my then
custom, while watching these droll birds, when not more
than two hundred yards ahead I saw two large eagles. One
of them was perched on a low cliff, the other was flying about,
now and then returning near to its mate. I dismounted, with
my revolver in my hand; I had a pocketful of cartridges. I
crept stealthily from rock to rock, keeping well out of their
sight until I came close to the pinnacled rock on which they
stood. I was then about fifty yards from them, and it was
useless my firing at such a distance with a revolver. I peeped
over the rocks, and one of them saw me and flew away, while
the other remained where it was, stretching its neck in my
direction. Its piercing eyes were fixed full on me as I was
approaching; it understood that danger was imminent, and it
seemed ready to resist the attack. I drew nearer and nearer,
and when about four yards away I fired two shots, both of
which went through its breast, and the eagle, with its widespread
wings, fell from its lofty pinnacle and came down
heavily on its back.</p>

<p>In its last convulsions it made desperate efforts to clutch
me with its long sharp claws; but a couple more shots
finished it. The male bird, which meanwhile had been describing
circles high up in the sky over my head, plunged down
on me with incredible velocity. I emptied the last chamber of
my revolver into him, just as the wind of his large wings made
my eyes twinkle; and to evade the grip of his outstretched
claws I had to cover my face with my left arm. The report
stunned him, and flapping his wings, he rose again, to resume
his circling over my head, leaving a few of his feathers floating
in the air. I reloaded quickly, and each time he attacked me
he was received with a volley. Another bullet went through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
his wing, and his flying became unsteady; he flew on to a distant
cliff, and there he remained. I seized this opportunity of
carrying the dead bird away and lash it on to my saddle; but
while I was so engaged the male eagle flew back to the pinnacle
where I had first seen the two together, and stretching
his enormous wings to their full width, screamed as if in despair.
On the pinnacle was their nest and young, and that was
why the female had kept watch and ward over her eyrie, and
also why she had not abandoned it even when I approached.</p>

<p>I mounted my pony and away I rode with my prey. The
male bird followed me for miles and miles, and now and then
I had to fire to keep him at a respectful distance. Ultimately
he left me, and my delight was immense when, instead of
seeing him over my head, ready to plunge on me at any
moment, I saw him disappear behind the cliff, flying rapidly
but unsteadily back to his eyrie.</p>

<p>As I now made sure that he had no intention of pursuing
me any longer, I dismounted, and proceeded to skin the eagle
I had shot. It was decidedly a magnificent specimen. It
measured seven feet from tip to tip of wings, and its claws
were nearly as large as a child's hand. The semicircular
nails measured two inches, and were extremely pointed, which
fact made me feel very thankful that I had just escaped the
grip of its male companion. The beak was enormous, of a
rich yellow colour, the upper mandible overlapping the lower.
The feathers were black all over, with the exception of the
tail, which was white. I believe that this kind of eagle is
generally called the "black sea-eagle," and is found in
Kamschatka, Yezo, and also along the Siberian coast of the
Japan Sea and Gulf of Tartary.</p>

<p>I found a sheltered spot, and with my large Ainu knife
proceeded to dissect the bird. Each minute seemed as long
as hours, for I feared the male bird might reappear on the
scene as I was thus occupied in stripping the skin from the
carcass of his beloved helpmate. There is no knowing
what effect anatomical researches might have on a Yezo eagle.
My heart bounded with joy when the operation was successfully
completed, and I went to wash my hands in the sea. I came
back to the bird, or rather its skin, and I was indeed proud of
my work, when a horrid idea struck me. How was I to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the skin dried? I should be moving day after day, and it
would not be possible to pack it in that condition among
my sketches; I had no arsenical soap, and unless I dried it
in the sun it would certainly rot, and get spoiled.</p>

<p>I resorted to a trick. I fastened two sticks crossways, and
having stuck one up the eagle's neck, I fastened the two
opened wings to the two side branches of the cross. The skin
was thus kept well opened, and with two additional strings, one
at each wing, the frame was fastened on to my back, the
feathered side against my coat, while the inside was exposed
to the sun and the wind. In wading a river I saw my own
image reflected in the water, and I must confess the appearance
was strange. A few hours after a group of Ainu were able to
certify to this. I was riding slowly along the shore, when I
saw a few of them not very far ahead. Two men were the
first to notice me, and they seemed terror-stricken. As I
approached they stood still for a minute, shading their eyes
with their hands so as to make out what kind of winged
animal it was they saw riding on horseback. When they
discovered that the black wings were on a human being, the
two brave Ainu fled, crying out, "<i>Wooi, wooi!</i>" the hairy
people's cry of distress.</p>

<p>As I got nearer the village, dozens of wild dogs came to
meet me, and, barking furiously, followed my pony, while the
few inhabitants, frightened out of their wits at such an unusual
sight, hid themselves inside their huts. Two or three hurriedly
launched their "dug-outs" and put out to sea. When I passed
the first hut some large salmon were thrown at me from inside,
probably with the idea that I might satisfy my appetite on
them, and spare the lives of the trembling donors. Food was
not over-plentiful along that coast, so I dismounted and picked
up the provisions so munificently provided by the scared
natives. I tied them on each side of my pack-saddle, not sorry
to be thus saved from the danger of dying of starvation&mdash;at
least for the next two or three days.</p>

<p>As I was so occupied, a little child about four years old,
evading the vigilance of his parents, ran out of one of the huts.
I took him in my arms; whereat he cried bitterly, and when
the people inside heard it there were screams of indignation
and despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Maternal love is occasionally strong even among Ainu
women, and while I tried hard to quiet the shrieking baby,
his mother, as pale as the dirt on her face allowed her to be,
came out trembling, and, offering me another large salmon,
begged me to accept it in exchange for her child, who, she
said, was not good to eat! It is needless to say that I was
magnanimous enough to accept her offer, and thereupon
handed the child over to his mother, who fled with him
back into the hut. Then I took off my wings and went in
after her, explaining to the frightened natives what I really
was. It took them some minutes, however, to overcome their
first impression, and then the men were pretty hard on the
women for having given all the salmon away. The same
scene was more or less vividly repeated when I came across
any other natives during all the time that I wore the eagle-skin
on my back. I have related this small anecdote, as, a
few years hence, when some worthy missionary or imaginative
traveller visits that barren coast of Yezo, it is not improbable
that he may hear of some additional Ainu legend, which, the
good missionaries will say, proves that the Ainu are fully
aware of the existence of heaven and hell.</p>

<p>"A heathen child," the legend will very likely run, "whose
parents had not embraced our Christian faith, was one day
plainly seen by his mother in the arms of a black-winged
devil. The devil was seen by many, and he came from the
lower regions on an unknown animal with huge side paunches,
in which he kept the heathen children he had eaten. The
mother, who, through her wickedness, saw herself deprived of
her child, gave offerings to the gods, some through the eastern
window for the sun-god, and some through the door for the
other gods. The offerings were accepted, but none of the
gods came to her help, and the child was nearly lost. Her
guiding star appeared to her in that supreme moment, and
inspired her to reach down from the roof the largest salmon
in store. She walked out of the hut and offered it to another
god, whom she knew not before. Instantly the child was
restored to his mother. (That the god took the salmon
would probably be omitted in the legend.) The black-winged
demon vanished, and the hut was visited by a white being
(freely translated, "the guardian angel"), with a halo (my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
white terai hat) round his head. He rewarded them, and
from that day the family has been happy in the faith which
they learned in such a miraculous manner."</p>

<p>"Does not this legend speak for itself?" the good
missionaries will tell us. "Does it not show that the savage
Ainu are Christians without knowing it?"</p>

<p>I have given these two versions of the same story, as they
show the reader how easy it is to garble accounts and misrepresent
facts. It is a good illustration of what I say in my
chapter on the Ainu beliefs and superstitions, and I must be
forgiven if I have ventured to make fun of the missionaries.
It is not because I dislike them, for I gladly admit that some
of them out in the East have done good work; but, unfortunately,
most of them will not take an open-minded view of
facts. They are so wrapped up in their good work of converting
people to Christianity that, outside of that, they
occasionally have a tendency to tinge with their own preconceived
ideas, facts which to a less biased mind appear simple
enough.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="small">On the North-East Coast&mdash;From Poronai to Cape Soya.</span></h2>


<p>It was late in the evening when I arrived at Poronai.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Saruru,
the last village I had passed, had only six Ainu and three
Japanese huts, and the nine or ten miles between there and
this place were most uninteresting. I was taken across one of
the quicksand rivers in the ferry by a lovely Ainu girl of about
twelve years of age. I have never seen a more picturesque
being than she was. She was partly dressed in skins, but half
her chest was bare; her wildly-curled black hair fell over her
shoulders, and while gracefully paddling across the ferry she
occasionally threw back her head, thus shaking back the hair
that the wind had blown over her eyes.</p>

<p>I have often noticed how supple the children of savages are,
and how like in ease and grace and unconscious rhythm their
movements are to those of wild animals. Sometimes, to be
sure, they have the jerky, quick, and ungraceful movements of
monkeys, but as a rule their actions are unconsciously graceful.
Of course, with our children such unconscious grace is rare at
any time, even when found at all, as from the day when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
are born we train them to artificiality of all kinds, and this
artificiality becomes in a sense second nature, overlaying, if
not destroying, the original impress. And yet that impress
is probably not wholly destroyed, for, so far as my own
experience goes, I, who had from my birth led a civilised life,
now that I had been for some months among barbarians had
so little conventionality left in me as to be quite happy, or
even happier than before, in leading a perfectly uncivilised
existence. In the absence of chairs and sofas, instinct and
the example of the natives taught me to squat as they did,
and when I had once got into the way of it I found the
position much more restful than any of our European so-called
comfortable ways of sitting. It was the same thing
when I had to sleep, either in the open air or in Ainu huts,
where there was no more bedding than sofas or easy chairs.
To protect myself from the cold I almost invariably slept
sitting on the ground, with my head resting on my knees, just
like the apes in the Zoological Gardens. I am sure that a
good many of my readers, who have never gone through such
an experience, will put me down as a "crank;" others will
say that I am a worthy companion of my friend the hairy
lunatic, and the most charitable will think that, bearing the
name of "Savage Landor," I am only indulging in a new
edition of "Imaginary Conversations," without the literary
merits of the old. Such is not the case. I have mentioned
these facts, not to amuse the reader, or merely for the sake of
paradox, but to show how shallow is the veneer of civilisation
which we are apt to think so thorough, and how a very
short time spent unaccompanied by men of one's own
stamp, and alone with "nature," rubs the whole thing away,
and brings us back to instinct rather than education. I
am willing to admit that not many people would care to
follow in my footsteps, and live as I lived for months
among the Ainu in order to prove whether I am right or
wrong. Many who have only sat in comfortable chairs or
slept in soft beds will hardly think my statements credible;
but as the experiences, besides being of great amusement,
were of great interest to me, I shall pass them on to my
readers, no matter what opinion they may form of him who
has written them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Another quality, merely instinctive, which I developed in
my lonesome peregrinations was the power of accurate tracking.
Most people are astonished at the wonderful tales told of the
tracking abilities of the Australian black fellows, and of
savages in general; but few ever think that if when young
they had led the same life as these savages they would be as
good trackers as the best. As there were absolutely no roads,
and I travelled with no guide, servant, or companion, the
power of discovering traces became invaluable to me. It was
instinctive in me, developed rather than acquired, and therefore
I mention it in connection with the other facts relating to
animal and human instincts. Furthermore, I may assert that,
until I was thus compelled to make use of that faculty, I was
not aware that I possessed it.</p>

<p>We find that horses, bears, and most animals are good
trackers. Dogs, the nearest in intelligence to men, are better
than any other quadruped. Then come savages, who are
the masters of tracking among human beings; but as we
rise in the scale of civilisation we find that this faculty of
following a slightly indicated track hardly exists. Does,
then, intellectual education destroy our instincts instead of
improving them?</p>

<p>Tracking on sandy or tufaceous ground is an easy matter,
as of course the foot leaves a well-marked print; but where
I found real difficulty was over rocky ground, until I got used
to it, and knew all the signs and what I had to look for. However,
with a little practice, even over rocks which the sea has
washed, it is not impossible to know if such and such creatures,
human or animal, have passed that way.</p>

<p>One of the first things in tracking is to look for marks
where they are likely to be; and this is just where the instinct
comes in. Next to this, a clear knowledge of the person's or
animal's way of walking and general habits is necessary. For
instance, when I tried to discern tracks of Ainu, I invariably
looked for them along the sea-shore, and failing that, on the
adjoining cliffs, as I well knew that if any Ainu had passed by
there he would have kept either along the coast or not far
from it. By examination it is easy to see if the ground has
been in any way disturbed of late. Sometimes a small stone
moved from the place where it had been for years shows a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
difference in colour where it has been affected by the weather
and where not, thus giving a distinct clue of some passer-by,
man or brute; and when once you have found what the
characteristics of the tracks are, the most difficult part of the
task is accomplished.</p>

<p>On weather-beaten rocks the trail is more difficult to strike,
and more difficult still on rocks over which the sea washes.
"For," say the simple people, "how can you see tracks on
hard stone? The foot certainly does not leave a print on
rocks as on sand; and even supposing that the feet were
dirty, the sea would wash away the marks, and you could
not see anything."</p>

<p>In my case I limited my search to bare-footed marks, as the
Ainu generally go bare-footed. Everybody knows that dogs
track by scent, and this is a sure proof that every footmark
must have a certain special odour, however infinitesimal. When
we remember that the act of walking makes the feet warm and
perspire, it is easy to understand that this perspiration, which
is a greasy substance, leaves a mark on the stone&mdash;though to
be sure it is sometimes almost imperceptible, especially when
quite fresh. But most of us, when children at school, have
noticed that touching a slate with moist fingers leaves a
greasy mark, which could not be rubbed off again. The same
thing happens when we tread on stones with bare feet. If the
sea washes over the stones after the greasy impression has
been thus made on them, it does nothing but accentuate these
marks, and show them more plainly, as the salt water acts in
one way on the untouched parts of the stone, but in a different
way where the grease has been absorbed. These marks are
generally very faint, and it requires some training before they
can be discerned; but when the knack is once acquired,
they become evident enough. To an observant eye, and
with a little practice, it is not difficult to perceive whether
one or more persons have tramped on a given place, and
in what direction they have travelled. The marks on stones
which are washed over by the sea are usually of a lightish
colour.</p>

<p>I could almost invariably distinguish the footmarks of an
Ainu from those of a Japanese, as the Ainu take longer
strides, and their toes are longer than those of the Japanese.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Moreover, with the latter, when walking the greater pressure
is forward under the foot, and their toes are turned in;
while in Ainu footprints the whole foot rests on the ground,
and they keep it perfectly straight, moving the two feet
parallel to each other.</p>

<p>I have given these few points on tracking, as it will explain
to the reader how I was able to find my way from one village
to another miles apart, to steer for huts where I had never
been, and to overcome great difficulties, which I could not
have surmounted if I had not learnt the art of tracking, and
so far developed my natural powers. My ponies were also to
a great extent my teachers; and by a close examination of
their instinct I learned that I myself possessed it, and improved
on it.</p>

<p>Between Sawaki, or Fujima, and Poronai there is a beautiful
forest of oak and hard-wood trees on the hills and firs on
the higher mountains, while the shore above the sea-wash is
covered with thick scrub-bamboo, which reaches a height of
about ten feet.</p>

<p>On the sandy beach, besides a large number of whales'
bones, there is any amount of driftwood.</p>

<p>At Poronai, which consisted of only eight huts, the
Ainu had adopted an architecture for their storehouses
different to that of other tribes. The walls and the roof
were made partly of wood, partly of the bark of trees.
Heavy stones were placed on the roof to prevent it from
being blown away during the strong gales so frequent along
that coast.</p>

<p>The natives described the winter weather as very severe,
especially during northerly winds, and they told me that some
years the sea all along the coast is frozen for some eight or ten
miles out, besides the drift-ice which sets in from the north
and works its way along the coast as far as Cape Nossyap, in
the neighbourhood of Nemuro. At the beginning of the
winter this ice, probably drifted across from Sakhalin by the
strong current in the La Perouse Strait, sets in from the north
and works down all along the north-east coast of Yezo, filling
up all indentations in the coast-line, and forming a solid mass
on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Seals are very plentiful on these shores as far as Abashiri,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
but the greatest number are found on the Saruma lagoon. In
winter it is not difficult to come within reach of them, but even
in September I saw many of them. They were, however, very
shy, and when they caught sight of me instantly disappeared
under water.</p>

<p>A few miles from Poronai I came to a headland, and about
one mile from it lay the small island of Chuskin.</p>

<p>The coast again, instead of being sandy, showed traces of
its volcanic formation, forming beautiful cliffs and a rugged
outline, rising in terraces at places, or cliffs of clay and gravel
sediments, with reefs extending far out to sea, while below
them stretched a beach of coarse sand or pebbles, strewn with
enormous volcanic boulders. These terraces are wooded
mostly with alder, Yezo fir, and beech.</p>

<p>Soon after crossing the Porobets River I came across the
wreck of a sailing ship, which lay flat on the shore disabled
and dismasted; and at last I reached Esashi. There I again
noticed a curious fact, which may be of some interest to
anthropologists; namely, that Yezo is mostly formed of
Tertiaries and volcanic rocks, and that the Ainu are mostly
to be found in regions of Cainozoic or Tertiary formation.
In volcanic districts they are very scarce. This is curious,
for it is a well-known fact that the typical life-form of
Tertiaries is anthropoid apes, and it is a remarkable coincidence
that we should find ape-like men populating the
same strata.</p>

<p>From Esashi the coast is extremely rough and rocky for
about eight miles. I had to take my famished pony up and
down steep mountains rising directly from the sea in places
where the beach was impassable. Owing to the lack of grass
my wretched beast had but little to eat; and what with the
danger of riding, and the miserable condition my pony was
in, I had to walk most of the way and lead him. Shanoi,
about thirteen miles further, came in sight&mdash;a group of
wretched fishermen's huts; and from here the coast was
somewhat better. The scenery all along is beautiful,
especially looking back towards the Shanoi Mountains. I
saw one or two abandoned huts blown down by the wind,
but no people.</p>

<p>Near Shanoi the eruptive rocks and granitic cliffs suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
come to an end, as well as the mountainous character of the
country, and for fifteen miles, till one comes to Sarubuts, the
country is pretty flat and swampy, with a thick vegetation
inland of spruce trees. There is a small lagoon formed by
the Tombets River, and which often has its mouth blocked
by the quicksands, which cause it to overflow.</p>

<p>I left Sarubuts in pouring rain, following the trail along the
beach. The river forms a long narrow lake similar to that
of Tombets, and at the back of it are terraces and high
lands, but no very high mountains. Another wreck of a large
boat lay in fragments on the sand, and after fifteen miles of
very uninteresting scenery I arrived at Chietomamai, a group
of four or five fishermen's huts. Here again the coast was
rough, but my pony did not sink in the sand as it did on
leaving Sarubuts, but it stumbled among large pebbles and
stones as pointed as needles. Further on were grey and
brown steep cliffs, which were extremely picturesque. The
Mezozoic nature of this coast shows more distinctly between
Chietomamai and Soya Cape, and a large rock emerging from
the sea is both peculiar and picturesque with its numerous
square sections. It is from this point that one gets the first
view of Soya Cape. Going round a bay one passes a few
fishermen's houses, and on the cliffs above them has been
erected the Siliusi lighthouse. I cleared the Cape and rounded
the bay on the other side, where I saw another wreck of a
sailing ship dashed upon the rocks, making the scene a sad
one. I still went on, and went round two or three smaller
headlands, when the melancholy sight of a fourth wreck stood
before me. This last ship had her stern out of the water, and
a Turkish name was painted on it. Her appearance also was
Turkish, and I was more than once puzzled as to what a
Turkish ship could have been doing in the La Perouse Strait.
Many months afterwards, on my return to Yokohama, but too
late to be of any help to them, the sad story of the survivors
of that ship was revealed to me. The mission of the ship in
those far-off seas was a mysterious one. No one ever knew
exactly whence she came, or whither she was bound. No one
ever learned whether she had been disabled in a typhoon in
the Chinese Sea, and had been drifted so far north by the
strong currents, or whether the careless Turkish master had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
mistaken his course and had met his fate in the dangerous
currents of La Perouse Strait. Only four of the crew survived.
There they were on that deserted coast, with no
clothes, no food, no money; but the few natives treated them
kindly. Two of them wore "<i>Tarbouches</i>" (red caps), the only
things they had saved from the wreck. The natives on the
north-west coast told me of these men who were tramping
their way south, unable to make themselves understood, continually
asking for "<i>Sekhara</i>," or "<i>Sakhara</i>," which, I believe,
in the Turkish language means tobacco or cigarettes. After
months of privations, half starved, and worn out with fatigue,
they reached Hakodate, where, having no passport, and not
being able to explain themselves, they were duly arrested
and sent down to Yokohama. Unfortunately for them,
at that time the "Entogroul," a Turkish man-of-war, had
come to Japan, a voyage which took her two years, to
bring some decorations which the Sultan had bestowed on
the Mikado. Osman Pasha, the Admiral, had the poor
devils brought before him, and they told him their sad story,
what they had suffered, and how they had lost their ship.
The story was too true to be believed, or too strange to
sound true!</p>

<p>"Impostors!" said Osman Pasha, and declining to listen
any more to their tale of woe, which he called "pure lies,"
had them "put in irons," in which condition they were to be
taken back to Constantinople. None of the foreign residents
in Japan believed the story of these wretches, and all
were glad to see the miscreants punished. "Impossible,"
said everybody, "that a Turkish ship should have been up
there!"</p>

<p>As it so happened, the "Entogroul," on her return trip
to Constantinople, was herself caught in a typhoon, and,
steaming full speed to resist the force of the wind and the
waves, her boilers burst, and Osman Pasha and nearly all
hands on board were blown to pieces or drowned. If I
remember right, over three hundred and sixty lives were
lost, and no doubt the four men, whose prison, I was told,
was near the boilers, thus found a tragic end to their life
of misery.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Yokohama all this had already happened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and my evidence, which probably might have saved the life of
these men, was therefore useless.</p>

<p>But let us return to Soya Cape, where we have left the
wreck.</p>

<p>The rapid current which comes through the Strait gives
a horrid look to the water, and I have never seen the sea look
so vicious. The natives of the small Soya village told me that
it is impossible to cross over to Sakhalin, the high mountains
of which, covered with snow and glaciers, I could see
distinctly. The distance from land to land is about twenty-eight
miles, but no small boat can get across without being
swamped. They told me also that often dead bodies of
Russians are washed on shore, probably unfortunate convicts
who found their death in attempting to obtain liberty. H.M.S.
"Rattler" was wrecked in 1868 on one of the numerous reefs
near this Cape, so the record of Soya could hardly be more
mournful.</p>

<p>After the Cape has been well rounded one finds oneself
in a bay opening due north. In the winter time this
bay is completely blocked with ice, but the Strait itself is
never entirely frozen, owing to the strong warm current
from the Chinese Sea, which the Japanese call by the name
of Kuroshiwo.</p>

<p>Soya village is a wretched place of thirty or forty sheds.
A few planks, badly joined together, and with a kind of a roof
over them, made my shelter for the night. Soya Cape is the
most northern point of the north-east coast, and before we
abandon it to move towards the south, along the west
coast, it is important to mention the peculiar and conspicuous
characteristic of the marked bending of watercourses in a south
or south-easterly direction. They are forced that way by the
drift-sand travelling along the coast from north-west to south-east
with the Kuroshiwo current, which drift-sand is in such
quantities as often to block altogether the mouths of some
rivers, and form the large lagoons so common along this coast.
The lack of harbours or sheltered anchorages, the inhospitable
and unfertile shores, the quicksands, and the severe climate,
besides the danger of being swamped and carried away by
the overflow of a lagoon or lake, make this coast of little
attraction for intending settlers or for pleasure-seekers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Herrings are plentiful all along the coast, but fishing stations
could not possibly pay, even if any were established, owing to
the difficulty and expense of carriage and freight, and the risk
that ships would run in calling at such exposed and unprotected
shores.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="small">From Cape Soya to the Ishikari River.</span></h2>


<p>From Soya the coast forms a large bay, which opens due
north, and which ends in Cape Soya on the eastern side and
in Cape Nossyap on the western. Almost in the middle is
the small village of Coittoe, and from this place, towering
beyond the flat Nossyap peninsula, one can see Rishiri
Island. Near the western part of the bay are some small
hills, covered mainly with fir-trees. Wakkanai, a Japanese
village, is on the west coast of the bay, and north of it is Cape
Nossyap. From this cape is a lovely view of Rishiri and
Repunshiri Islands. Rishiri is a volcanic cone 6,400 feet
above the level of the sea. It has the identical shape of the
famous Fujiama in Southern Japan, and rising as it does in
graceful slopes directly from the sea, has the appearance of
being higher than it really is. Repunshiri is hilly and partly
of volcanic formation, but none of its peaks rise to a higher
altitude than five hundred feet.</p>

<p>Rishiri is almost circular at sea-level, and it has no well-sheltered
nor safe anchorages; but Repunshiri has one good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
anchorage on its north coast. Rishiri is about six and a half
miles in diameter and twenty-five miles distant, directly west
of Cape Nossyap; Repunshiri is eleven miles long, about four
and a-half wide, and eleven miles distant to Ikaru, its nearest
point east on the Yezo coast. As the Kuriles are a continuation
east of the volcanic zone of Yezo, there is no doubt that
Rishiri and Repunshiri are the terminus of the same volcanic
zone at its north-west end.</p>

<p>From Wakkanai a new horse-track has been opened to
Bakkai, on the north-west coast. The ride for the first eleven
miles was uncomfortable, as my pony, a worn-out brute, sank
up to its belly in the mud; but in due course I came to the
hilly part, and after having gone up one steep pitch and down
another for a considerable distance, I rapidly descended a
precipitous bank, and followed the soft sandy beach till I
reached Bakkai. Here there is a large and peculiar stone,
which the Ainu say resembles an old woman carrying a child
on her back. It stands perpendicularly out of the ground
at a great height, and it is of a rich dark-brown colour. If
the north-east coast was barren and deserted, the western
shore of Yezo was even yet more desolate. For thirty or
forty miles, as far as the Teshio River, the beach was strewn
with wrecks and wreckage. Here you saw a boat smashed to
pieces; there a mast cast on the shore; further on a wheel-house
washed away by the waves; then the helm of a disabled
ship. It was a sight sad enough to break one's heart, with
all the tragic circumstances it suggested.</p>

<p>Between Bakkai and Wadamanai especially, I do not think
that one can go more than a few yards at a time without being
reminded by the wreckage which is strewn thick on the coast
of some calamity. A white life-boat, with her stern smashed,
lay on the sand helpless to save, and as a kind of satire on
her name; and at Wadamanai, a large Russian cruiser, the
"Crisorok," dismasted and broken in two, lay flat on the beach
half covered with sand. Her bridge had been washed away
and her deck had sunk in. Some of the bodies of her gallant
officers and crew had been washed on shore by the sea. No
one knows in what circumstances the ship was lost, but it is
probable that during last winter, when she came to her ill-fated
end, her rigging and sails got top-heavy with ice, and that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
capsized. Some of the wreckage one finds on that coast has
been drifted there from the Chinese Sea by the Kuroshiwo
current; and then, owing to the La Perouse Strait turning so
sharply to the east, has been left on this last portion of the
coast. Here and there a rough tent made with a torn sail, or
a deserted shed knocked up out of pieces of wreckage, is a
suggestive reminder that some unfortunate derelict seafarer
had suffered and striven for life on these forlorn sands. An
enormous quantity of drift-logs, and here and there some
bones of whales, are strewn all along the beach.</p>

<p>At Wadamanai there is a mere rough shed under the shelter
of the sand-hills. When I left this place, moving south, a
strong gale blew, which made the travelling most unpleasant.
It was getting fearfully cold, and now that I needed clothes
so badly mine were falling altogether to pieces. My "unmentionables,"
which reached down to my feet when I left Hakodate
at the beginning of my journey, had long since been
trimmed and reduced to a kind of knickerbockers. Then the
knees got worn out, and they became more like bathing-breeches;
and finally I dispensed with them altogether, and
made use of them to protect my sketch-book and diary, round
which I wrapped what remained of the ex-garment. My
boots, of course, were a dream of the past, and little by little
I was getting accustomed to walking barefooted. Thus,
dressed in a coat, a belt ... and nothing else, I moved along
this inhospitable coast, half frozen, but not discomfited.</p>

<p>The mouths of some of the small rivulets were extremely
nasty to cross, as my pony sank in the quicksands. I had
to help him out, and that meant a cold bath each time. From
Wadamanai I kept a little more inland, still steering for the
south, and every now and then I again struck the beach.
Still the old sad story of wreckages strewn all over the shore,
sailing boats smashed to pieces, junks disabled and half buried
in sand, met me at every turn, creating in my mind a very
monotony of melancholy.</p>

<p>Late in the evening I reached the mouth of the Teshio
River, a broad deep watercourse, one of the three largest rivers
in Hokkaido, the other two being the Ishikari and the Tokachi.
It has a long course in a general north-westerly direction, and
then sharply turns southward, running parallel with the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
for about four miles, and forming a kind of lagoon at its outlet,
which seems now to be working towards the northward again.
All the other rivers on the west coast tend northward owing
to the drift-sand which the current brings north. It is strange
that the Teshio should partly be an exception to this rule,
though we have ample evidence, even in this watercourse, of
the movement of the sand, for the bar at its mouth almost
entirely blocks its entrance, and rapidly works in a northerly
direction. Thus there is no doubt that the sand travels
towards the north all along the west coast.</p>

<p>Sea-trout is abundant in the Teshio River, but salmon, with
which this stream formerly abounded, are now less plentiful
owing to the sand-bar which blocks the entrance.</p>

<p>A gale was blowing fiercely when I crossed the lagoon in a
small Ainu "dug-out," and my pony was made to swim across.
Two or three times we nearly capsized, and we shipped a lot
of water. It was just like sitting in a bath with water up to
my waist; but the Ainu, who had as much as he could do to
paddle me across and tow the pony as well, comforted me by
saying, "Now that his 'dug-out' was full, we could not ship
any more water, and that his skiff, being made of wood, could
not sink!"</p>

<p>After a long struggle we got safely to the other side, and
the Ainu boatman guided me for a mile or so to the fishing
village at the mouth of the river. It has but ten huts, all more
or less miserable. The pony was so done up that he was
hardly fit to carry my traps, much less could he have borne
my weight. I could not get a fresh animal, so I had to push
forward walking, and dragging the beast on as well as I could.
This had the advantage of keeping me warm, which I needed
badly, for what with the cold and my dilapidated costume I
was more nearly frozen to death than was pleasant. The
track was heavy in the soft sand, and the dangerous and
numerous quicksand streams were enough to make a saint
swear&mdash;if swearing would have done any good. How unspeakably
desolate it all was! Not a soul to be met; not a
hut to be seen! Here and there more wreckage and drift-wood
on the shore, telling of storms and death, and the absence
of all human aid. At last I came in sight of an Ainu hut; but
as I drew near I found that it was abandoned. My meals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
never very plentiful, were now specially scanty&mdash;few and far
between; and, taken altogether, this part of my travels in
Ainuland was somewhat lacking in cheerfulness.</p>

<p>The cliffs near Wembets have the strange appearance of
so many cones at equal intervals along the coast. On the
Wembets River there were as many as two huts; and here
again I had to cross in a boat, the stream being too deep
to ford on foot or horseback; then again along the sand,
dragging my pony, while I myself could hardly stand on
my half-skinned feet, I went on and on, wearied of the
monotony of my miserable experiences. The track grew
narrow, and always worse. The high grey cliffs of clay-rock
began, and the rough sea washed up to the foot of
them, making progress more than ever unpleasant and
dangerous. Each wave that came brought the water up
to my knees, often up to my waist, and for about ten
miles I was continually in and out of water. On a cold
day my readers can imagine how pleasant it was! About
sunset I came in sight of the two flat islands of Teuri and
Yangeshiri, about fifteen miles off the coast. It then grew
dark; but the moon came to my help, shining brightly on the
greyish cliffs. The tide had risen, and in several places I had
great difficulty in getting across on account of the furious
waves dashing against the cliffs, and making a picturesque and
living sheet of foam.</p>

<p>Late at night, as I had almost given up all hope of finding
a shelter, I came upon a shed on the Furembets River, where
I put up for the night.</p>

<p>My wretched pony was nearly dead with fatigue, and I let
him loose so that he might get a feed of grass. The next
morning, after the inmates of the hut had volunteered to go
and bring him back to me, I heard them on the distant hills
calling, "<i>Pop, pop, pop, pop!</i>" the Ainu way of approaching and
calling horses. After a time they came back hopeless, saying
that the brute had bolted, and there was no hope of getting
him again. He could not be found anywhere! I was in the
most awful dilemma, for had that been the case I would have
been forced to abandon all my impedimenta, consisting of
sketches and painting materials, and proceed as best I could
on foot. Under other circumstances I could have carried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
baggage on my back easily; but as I was half-starved, and had
my feet badly cut, I was hardly able to carry my own weight;
therefore this was not possible now.</p>

<p>As incredulity is one of the useful qualities I possess, I went
to look after my pony myself. The shed was protected by a
sand-mound at the back, and a small space was left between
the mound and the wall of the shed. I do not know what
made me go and look there, but sure enough there was my
pony lying flat, and almost too weak to get up again. This
was no horse-stealing ruse on the part of the Ainu; simply the
wretched animal's own idea of good stabling and likely fodder.
I dragged him out of his involuntary prison, and after having
done what I could for his comfort and well-being, we set out
once more on our melancholy travels. This may sound cruel
to some who in the course of their life have never travelled
in out-of-the-way places, and who are ready to condemn anyone
who is the means of letting an animal suffer. It may
sound cruel in our humane country, where animals are protected
and prize-fights tolerated and enjoyed; so to avoid
misunderstandings it might be as well for me to say, that as
regards this tired pony it was simply the matter to push on
with him as far as I could or lose all the valuable materials I
had collected during months of sufferings and privations. No
ponies were to be got for any money along that deserted
coast, for there were none in existence. I did my best to
alleviate the poor animal's sufferings by undergoing myself a
considerable amount of pain, walking most of the way with my
feet a mass of sores; and as winter was rapidly coming on, I
was more than anxious to make my way south with all the
speed I could, to prevent being blocked up with snow and ice
and forced to spend the winter on this inhospitable coast.
Consequently, I was, as a matter of fact, more cruel to myself
than to my animals; to the others, those who will still cast
the first stone at me, I can wish no better punishment than to
be placed in the same position I was then. The trail became
somewhat better, as it led over the cliffs for about three miles;
then again it was on the beach. The high cliffs varied from
a very rich burnt sienna colour to a nice warm grey, and in
some places they are perfectly white, like the cliffs at Dover.
Conical mounds frequently occur, and give a curious aspect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
this deserted shore. Ten miles further on, at Chukbets, I
found a couple of huts; then I walked and dragged the pony
on the cliffs for about four miles; then again I resorted to
the beach; and finally I entered Hamboro, a small village,
or rather a picturesque group of sheds and huts, and a capital
fishing-station. <i>Shake</i>, salmon, <i>mashe</i>, and herrings are caught
in abundance at the mouth of this river. A short distance
from here hundreds of carcasses of seals were scattered
on the beach, whence emanated pestilential odours. On
account of the slowness of my pony I had to-night a
modified repetition of last night's experience, but neither
was the sea so rough nor the trail so narrow at the bottom of
the cliffs; and though my wretched animal was naturally in
a worse condition than before, I was able to push on to
Tomamai that same night, where I arrived at a small hour
of the morning.</p>

<p>At Tomamai, the coast, which had described a long curve,
the two ends of which are Ikuru north and this point south,
turns sharply in a southerly direction, running straight for
many miles from north to south.</p>

<p>From Tomamai southwards the coast is not quite as deserted
as it was further north, for here and there are villages
of fishermen's houses. The population, however, is a migratory
one, and when I went through, the herring-fishing season
was over, and consequently most of the houses were abandoned
and the people had migrated south. The winter weather is
very severe, and the houses have to be barricaded with thick
piles of wood as a protection against the strong westerly gales.
The boats had been drawn far on shore, where they were
well fastened to posts, and rough sheds thatched with grass
built over them.</p>

<p>Along the coast there was a string of these habitations, hut
after hut, storehouse after storehouse, but hardly a soul to be
seen. It was like going through the city of the dead. Many
of the fishermen's huts were built on the side of the rugged
cliffs, and they stood on piles about fifteen feet high, the back
of the house resting on the cliff itself. Twelve and a half
miles further another row of houses, similarly deserted for the
winter, stood along the shore-line at Onishika. In this part
of the coast salmon are very scarce, and the chief industry is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the herring fishery. There are no Ainu to be found either at
Tomamai or Onishika.</p>

<p>I continued my lonesome ride in the pouring rain, and soon
came to a peculiar long tunnel, natural and partly excavated,
between this place and Rumoi, a village prettily situated on
the slope of a hill fifteen miles further. This place possesses
a small anchorage at the mouth of the river, which is now only
fit for junks and small sailing-boats, but could be considerably
improved. Good coal has been discovered some way up
the river. There is a track on the cliffs leading to Mashike.
All along the coast are any number of fishermen's houses, but
they were all closed and barricaded. Ultimately, descending
from the cliffs in a zig-zag fashion, after another ten miles'
ride I found myself at Mashike, the largest Japanese village
in the Teshio district. Close to the tunnel there is a small
Ainu village, where the natives let their hair grow very long,
and then tie it up in a kind of knot, similar to the Corean
fashion of head-dress, while the women have given up tattooing
altogether. The fishermen at Mashike seem to suffer
greatly from "<i>Kaki</i>," or rheumatism, and cancer, while consumption,
malarial fever, and typhus are in a small proportion.</p>

<p>I had to stop over one day at Mashike, for the river was
swollen by the heavy rains, and it was impossible to get across.
On the other side of it stood Mashike-san, a huge volcanic
mountain rising sheer from the sea, and forming Cape
Kamuieto, under the shelter of which lies Mashike village;
and further south Cape Uhui projects into the sea. It is the
end of a mountain range which here runs north and then
south again, in the latter part forming one side of the upper
basin of the Teshio River. Mashike is the largest settlement
either on the north-east or west coast of Yezo. Its population
is partly migratory, but not so wholly as is the case with the
villages I had previously passed. I was delayed still another
day owing to the condition of the river; for the rain, instead
of decreasing, poured down to such an extent that the stream
could not be crossed, the current being too swift and the water
too deep. The sea was also too rough to allow of my leaving
Mashike in a canoe.</p>

<p>On the third day I rose early, and decided to attempt this
much-desired crossing of the river. It had not rained during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the night, and the waters seemed to have slightly diminished.
As the stream runs down a very steep incline on the slopes of
Mashike Mountain, the current rushes with tremendous force.
It was about five in the morning when I took my baggage to
the river bank. It was made up in two bundles, which I tied
together firmly with a leather strap. Some of the natives
who had collected round me entreated me to give up this
foolish idea, for they said I should infallibly lose my life if I
attempted to wade across the swollen river.</p>

<p>I saw at once that my pony would never be able to cross,
so I left him, and, taking the baggage on my head, and passing
my hands through the strap, I went into the water. The
current was indeed so strong that, weak as I was, I could
hardly stand against it. I had nearly reached the middle,
with the water up to my mouth, when I fancied I heard the
anxious crowd scream to me, "<i>Abunai! abunai! abunai!</i>"&mdash;"Look
out! look out! look out!" Startled and alarmed at
this piercing cry I turned my head, and saw within a few yards
of me a huge trunk of a tree coming swiftly down with the
current. There was a bump, and I saw nothing more. Half a
minute later I was violently thrown on the opposite bank, and
in trying to stand up on my feet in the shallow water my right
foot unfortunately got jammed between two stones in the
river bed; I was knocked down again, and broke my heel-bone
just under the ankle. Several natives came to my rescue
and I was lifted out of the water, half-stunned, half-drowned,
but still holding fast to my load. I was nearly frozen, and
trembling like a leaf from cold. When I tried to stand my
right leg collapsed, and I had to lie down on the ground.
What with the blow which I had received from the floating
wood, what with the muddy water I had involuntarily swallowed,
it took me some minutes before I could quite understand
my situation, or what had befallen me. When I did I
felt a terrible pain in my right leg. I looked, and there, on the
sand, under my foot and leg, which were swollen up to an
enormous size, was a pool of blood; the broken bone had
penetrated the skin, and was exposed to the air. When I
recovered my senses well enough I got a man to tear the wet
lining of my drenched coat, and with it and a few improvised
splints I proceeded to set my own broken bone. It was hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
work; but with the help of some natives I bandaged it up as
well as I could, and with the extra help of a coarse flaxen
rope I made a fairly good surgical job of the whole thing.</p>

<p>Stopping there till I grew better would have been foolish,
for winter was setting in; everything would soon be frozen
and snowed up, and, far from all my friends, as well as from
anything like civilised life or elementary comforts as I was, I
should probably have died. As long as I had a spark of life left
in me I decided that I would struggle and push on, come what
might. Two men undertook to carry me over the Mashike
Mountain, which rises to an altitude of 3,600 feet above the
sea-level. The mountain is thickly wooded, and the trail is
steep, heavy, and in many places dangerous, and when we
reached a sufficient altitude the trail was merely in the bed of
a rivulet composed mainly of huge stones. Travelling in the
state in which I was, was something like going to one's own
funeral. The jerking and the cold were excruciating; the
continuous stumbling and unsteady walk of my men over the
rough and slippery slopes did not improve my condition; but
finally we reached the summit. What a lovely view! One
could see far along the Teshio coast on the one side and down
towards the Ishikari on the other, and towards the east rose up
a picturesque chain of thickly-wooded mountains. Rising from
the sea stood the fine Cape Airup, near Moi; then far beyond,
dimly seen in the mist, was the towering outline of Shakotan.
We went down the other side, and my men, poor fellows, did
their best to cheer me up. One of them told me a cheering
story of a grizzly bear&mdash;which, by the way, he said were
numberless on this mountain&mdash;that had killed and eaten two
children, and also their father when the latter went to their
rescue. The other told me of the many men who had perished
in crossing the mountain; some had been overtaken by a snowstorm,
others had lost their way and fallen over precipices,
while others again had been killed by avalanches in winter.</p>

<p>Listening to this lively conversation, shaken and suffering,
I arrived late at night at Moi, having been carried over a
distance of twenty-five miles, to do which occupied about
eighteen hours. There was no possible way of getting across
the mountains between here and Atzta, as the high granitic
perpendicular cliffs are unscalable, and I was bound to entrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
my life to a small Ainu canoe. Two other passengers, a
Japanese woman and a man, asked if I would allow them to
travel in the boat with me; and then we three, rowed by an
Ainu man, put out to sea. The sea was rough outside, but as
the large bay was well protected by the Aikap Cape, all went
right at first; but in rounding the point we went too near the
rocks, got caught in a breaker, and shipped so much water
that the canoe began to slowly sink under the additional
weight. The Ainu was pretty smart, and he put his skiff on
the rocks. Between him and the two passengers I was helped
out, and while the Ainu emptied the canoe, the two Japanese
undressed entirely and spread out all their clothes and
underclothes in the sun to dry.</p>

<p>We got on board again, and, coasting more carefully, passed
several small fishing villages, of which Gokibira is the largest
and most important. It is backed by high mountains ranging
from twelve hundred to seventeen hundred and more feet
above the sea. One of the mountains&mdash;the highest&mdash;is called
Okashi-nae-yama.</p>

<p>Atzta is a long narrow village, of which almost all the
houses are built against the cliff. From here I had to begin
riding again along the bad and stony coast, among drift-wood,
and up and down cliffs. Anyone who has ever had any broken
bones will appreciate the tortures which I had to go through.
Owing to pain, exhaustion, and fatigue I had no control over
my pony, and could hardly stick on to the saddle. I took the
precaution of tying the bridle to my wrist, for should the pony
knock me off, he could not bolt away; but, unhappily, sometimes
this was the means of his dragging me mercilessly on
the ground for dozens of yards before he would stop. Then I
had to wait for some charitable passer-by to help me into the
saddle again, for I could no longer mount by myself. Day
after day of this wretched life made me feel almost unconscious
that I had a pain. I took things as they came, and I
went on. Now that I sit here in a comfortable chair writing
this by a cosy fire, I am myself astonished at my own perseverance.
If I were called upon to go through the same experience
now I could not. But in truth there are many things that one
does not mind doing for motives of pleasure which one would
never dream of attempting under the compulsion of an external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
will. Kutambets is picturesquely situated in a large
gully formed by a break in the red-tinted cliffs. From Kutambets
to Moroi the track is slightly better, and from this to
Ishikari it is quite easy. The latter river, a very large one,
has to be crossed by a ferry, as the habitations are on the
south banks of the stream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="small">The Ishikari River.</span></h2>


<p>On the north side of the mouth of the Ishikari River is an
Ainu village called Raishats. Its inhabitants are not natives
of this island, but were imported by the Japanese Government
from Sakhalin when it was exchanged with Russia for the
Kuriles.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the river, and close to this village, another
wreck&mdash;of the "Kamida Maru"&mdash;a schooner, ended the
mournful list of disasters on this inhospitable coast.</p>

<p>The Ainu of Raishats are different in some ways from the
Yezo Ainu proper. They call themselves Kraftu Ainu,
"Kraftu"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> being the Ainu name for Sakhalin. Their skin is
of a lighter colour; but the principal difference is in their eyes
and eyebrows. The Kraftu Ainu have eyes of the Mongolian
type, though larger, while the Yezo Ainu have not; and their
eyebrows have a very pronounced curve near the nose.
Most of the women seemed to suffer from consumption, and
the men also did not seem as strong as the other Ainu. The
women tattoo on their lips a small square pattern instead of
the long moustache, and most of them have now adopted
Japanese <i>kimonos</i>, or else wear gowns similar to those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Russian peasants. Some also wear skin gowns similar to
those of the Kurilsky Ainu, ornamented with feathers and
bits of molten lead sewn on them. A velvet cap or a kind of
tiara is their head-gear, and this also is ornamented with gold
and silver or red beads, or else is embroidered in bright colours.</p>

<p>The children are arrayed in more gaudy colours than their
elders. They have bright red embroideries round their necks,
and the whole gown is full of spangles and beads, the proceeds
of parental barter. A peculiar paunch-suspender, which I saw
here for the first time, was ingenious, and answered a great
want in the Ainu country. As will be seen later, the majority
of Ainu children have huge paunches, mostly due to the inability
of the hairy people to tie and secure properly the umbilical cord
at the child's birth. This not only produces great discomfort
to the child, but often causes its death. The belt which I saw
was made on the principle that the weight of the paunch,
under which passed a kind of net made of strips of skin, was
supported by braces going over the shoulders, and by this contrivance,
if the original lesion did not get much better it did
not get worse, as it does when not taken any care of at all.
Neither men nor women wore earrings; but the fair sex wore
a kind of velvet ribbon necklace round their neck, and on this
ribbon were sewn ornaments of molten lead, silver, and other
metals.</p>

<p>The habitations, storehouses, and customs of these Ainu
are similar to those of the others. As I slowly rode along the
banks of the river just before sunset, retracing my steps
towards the Ishikari village, I saw a hidden trail, which
apparently led to the woods. I made my pony follow it, and
shortly afterwards I came to a graveyard. As I have said,
the Ainu are extremely jealous of their burial-places, and they
resent strangers, even Japanese, going near them. It was
nearly fifteen days since the accident to my leg had occurred,
and though I could neither walk nor stand on it, still I was
beginning to be accustomed to the agony, and with great
trouble and pain I could dismount from my tiny pony. Strange
to say, mounting was not so difficult, for I could pull myself up
with my arms, lie flat on my stomach on the saddle, and then
swing round, and it did not jar me as much as coming down.
I had my paint-box fastened to the saddle, and I unlashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
it to take a sketch. The tombs were so many trunks of
trees cut and carved, and with one branch left on one side (<i>see</i>
<a href="#Page_218">Chapter XXI.</a>). One tomb particularly was more ornamented,
and it had a flat-shaped monument, roughly but well carved
at its head. An object resembling the bottom of a "dug-out"
covered the body, and this was also carved. At each of the
four corners a wooden blade was stuck in the ground. From
the stench I should think that the body was only a few inches
underground.</p>

<p>Fate had punished me so severely of late for faults which I
never committed that I thought myself now entitled to commit
a fault for the sake of squaring accounts. One of the small
wooden blades, nicely carved, would just go under my coat.
I decided to steal it. To my mind it was hardly a big enough
crime even to balance the last accident I had had.</p>

<p>I turned round to see that no one was looking. I put down
my paint-box, crawled to the grave, took the blade, put it
under my coat, and, ashamed of myself for committing the
outrage&mdash;though with prepaid punishment&mdash;I scrambled up
on my pony as well I could, and hurriedly left the place. I
rode back to the ferry, a long way off, and went across to
Ishikari, and catching a moment when no one was watching
me, I quickly passed the carved blade from under my coat
into my baggage.</p>

<p>"What a good thief I would make," I thought to myself,
when to my horror I remembered that in the hurry of leaving
the graveyard I had forgotten my paint-box in the very
same spot from which I had taken the blade!</p>

<p>If any Ainu had gone to the graveyard and found it, I
would get into a nice mess! During the night I felt more
than uncomfortable about it, and at dawn the next morning I
got the tea-house man to bring my horse and set me on it, for
I said, "I wish to go and see the sunrise from the other side
of the river."</p>

<p>The landlord thought it rather funny, and funnier still when
he saw me coming back a couple of hours later with a paint-box
lashed to my saddle, while he said he was sure I had
started without one.</p>

<p>"Did you not see it this morning?" said I with assumed
innocence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
"No, your honourable," said he, drawing in his breath.</p>

<p>"You did not look for it in the right place," said I, and
up to this day the landlord does not know where the right
place was.</p>

<p>The Ishikari is one of the great salmon rivers of Yezo.
About the end of September the salmon enter the river to
spawn. They are in such abundance then that the stream is
crowded thick with them, and it is quite sufficient to have a
hook fastened to a stick to pull out a large fish each time
it is dipped into the water. Millions of fine salmon are caught
within a few days, and the banks of the river are packed with
dead fish, while the whole population is occupied in splitting
open each fish, taking out its inside, for preservation.</p>

<p>The same method of netting as is practised for sardine
fishing is employed for salmon. Eighteen or twenty excited
men vigorously row the boats out into mid-stream, and after
describing a semicircle, return to the bank. The nets are
hauled in, the fish flung out on the river banks, and the same
process begins <i>de novo</i>. A man in a "dug-out" watches when
the salmon are more or less plentiful, and signals for the boat to
start, while he himself spears them with a harpoon. At the
right time of the year as many as 1500 or 2,000 and more
good fish are caught each time the net is hauled in. This
grand take of course only lasts a few days.</p>

<p>Though good, the Yezo salmon has none of the fine qualities
of the salmon of northern European rivers, and it is not quite
so good as that of the Canadian rivers. It does not keep so
well, and in colour is much lighter than our salmon.</p>

<p>The Ishikari River opens to the north, and runs parallel to
the coast, leaving a flat tongue of sand between it and the sea.
Following the course of the stream against the current, it goes
winding south, then sharply turns to the south-east, following
this direction for about fourteen miles. Then again it
winds up to the north, and then to the east for a distance of
over one hundred miles, where its source lies in the very heart
of Yezo.</p>

<p>The Ishikari carries a large body of water, and it is nine
hundred and twenty feet wide near its mouth. Its "drainage
area" has been estimated to be over three thousand square
miles, including mountain slopes, while the actual valley does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
not, in my opinion, exceed eight hundred square miles. The
river receives many affluents, of which the most important are
the Rubeshibe, Chupets, Piegawa, the Sorachi River, and
the Toyohira on its south side, and the Uriugawa on its north
side. Near the coast the valley is wooded mainly with scrub
oak, but further inland its banks are heavily timbered. The
Sorachi River is the most important affluent on the south side.
It is navigable for "dug-outs" and small sailing boats for
some considerable distance. At Sorachi one strikes the new
road which leads from the Poronai coal mines to Kamikawa,
where the site has been chosen for the intended new capital of
Hokkaido.</p>

<p>The road between Sorachi and the latter place not being
metalled, was exceedingly bad owing to the heavy rains, and
my pony continually sank in mud up to his belly. The road
follows the course of the Ishikari River more or less; and in
the woods is a military settlement like those we have seen
near Nemuro and Akkeshi. At Otoyebukets the traveller
must change horses. About eight miles further on one
reaches the Kamuikotan rapids, a poetic spot: huge rocks
in the water, violently rushing between and over them, form
pretty waterfalls. The Ainu occasionally shoot down these
rapids in their "dug-outs," and remains of these are to be
seen here and there smashed on the rocks. From this point
the road rises almost all the way, and the wayfarer must
cross over the hill range, from the top of which the whole
plain of Kamikawa can be seen, in the upper basin of the
Ishikari, which, winding like a silver snake, intersects the flat
valley.</p>

<p>Descending the hill on the other side, I reached the future
capital of Hokkaido. It is indeed a town of the future, for
at the present moment there are only five houses, if I may call
them so. The site of this embryo metropolis is by the
Chubets River; and on the hill called Nayosami I was told a
palace for the Emperor is to be erected. However, they were
not certain about it yet. It is a pretty hill, almost in the
centre of the large plain, and from the top of it one gets a
lovely view of a volcanic cone standing in front of you to the
south. Near this hill the new road turns sharply almost at a
right angle, and two miles further some <i>Tondens</i> have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
begun (<i>Ciuta Hombu</i>). Hundreds of convicts, who, by the
way, have made the road between here and Poronai, were at
work continuing the same road towards the east. I believe
that eventually it will be prolonged to the north-east coast,
where it will end near Abashiri. In my opinion the scheme
practically will be a failure, for Kamikawa will never be a
flourishing place, as there is nothing to support a large population.
From a strategic point of view of course Kamikawa
has the advantage of being in the centre of Yezo.</p>

<p>Kamikawa is 342 feet above the level of the sea, but it is
well sheltered, and the climate, though very cold, is not quite
so severe as in other parts of Yezo.</p>

<p>The Ainu of the upper Ishikari are nearly the same as the
Saru Ainu, only somewhat taller and more ill-tempered. They
show greater skill than other Ainu in wood-carving and
general ornamentation. Along the banks of the river huts
are scattered here and there; but the largest number is at
Chubets.</p>

<p>At the present moment the Japanese population of Kamikawa
is, with the exception of half-a-dozen policemen and as
many civilians, composed entirely of convicts. These are
dressed in red coats and trousers, and those who have committed
murder have the top of their head shaved in the shape
of a bottle (Jap., <i>Hetzui</i>). If any misbehave, they are
beaten with the flat side of the long sword worn by the policeman
in charge; but I must confess that otherwise the policemen
are extremely kind in every way to these fellows. The
well-behaved have one, two, or three small pieces of black cloth
sewn to their left sleeve. They are made to work hard, but
save this enforced diligence they seem to have a pretty good
time. As I was talking to a policeman in charge, two dead
men were brought on a cart by a man who had a towel over
his mouth and a red blanket over his head. The two men had
died suddenly. They had arrived only a few days previously
from Southern Japan, where cholera was raging, and they had
all the symptoms of having died of that deadly disease.</p>

<p>A very exciting way of retracing your steps down to the
Sorachi River is to shoot the rapids in an Ainu "dug-out."
You make one or two Ainu moderately drunk, as otherwise
they do not seem anxious to attempt it, and when they are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
that pot-valiant condition you get them to paddle your canoe
down the stream, while you sit in the bottom holding on to the
sides. You start with the velocity of a turtle, increase it to
that of a horse, then to that of a swallow, and when you are
well in the rapids it is like travelling on an arrow. You go
rubbing against rocks, and are shot in the air when going over
a small waterfall, only to fall with a splash in the water some
yards further, with an increase of velocity as you go on. It
really requires but little skill to navigate rapids, for it is the
current itself that does all the work. All that is needed is to
keep the "dug-out" straight in the water. Of course if you
should happen to collide with a rock when you are going at
nearly double the rate of an express train you would have
little chance of saving your life; but if you are neither smashed
nor drowned, and you do not come to grief in any way, you
can accomplish the journey, which takes you the whole day by
land, in little over one hour when there is plenty of water in
the stream.</p>

<p>On the road from Sorachi to Poronai, and halfway between
the villages of Naye and Takigawa, a new coal mine has been
discovered and opened, which is said to be very rich in mineral
of good quality; in fact, superior to the coal of Poronai. It
is ten miles from Otaussi Nai village, where the high road has
to be abandoned if the mine is to be visited.</p>

<p>There are many Ainu both at Takikawa-Mura (Waterfall-River
village), at Otaussi, and at Poronai-buts. Poronai has
in its neighbourhood some rich coal mines. As others have
reported more accurately and correctly than I can on the
quality and extent of these coal seams, I shall abstain from
repeating or copying what has been already said. I may,
however, mention that the seams cut the valley of the Ikusum
River eight miles from Poronai-buts, and a continuation of
them is found near the springs of the Sorachi. The coal beds
of Poronai are about three and a half feet deep, and many
different beds have been found deeper than these, but of
inferior quality. Poronai also goes by the name of Ishikishiri,
and a large penitentiary has been erected here for the accommodation
of the numerous convicts exported from the Main
Island to improve the scheme for the colonisation of Yezo.
I was called on by the chief <i>yakunin</i> (officer), and he expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
a wish that I should inspect the prisons. A splendid horse
was sent to convey me thither, and two policemen helped me
on my progress through the buildings, owing to my inability
to walk more than a few yards at a time. It was a large
walled enclosure, with houses for the officials and cells for the
<i>akambos</i>, a jocular term, meaning "babies," which is applied to
convicts, because they wear red clothes like children. The
buildings were beautifully clean, but what astonished me most
was that no precaution whatever was adopted to prevent convicts
from escaping. The outside gates were all wide open;
there were neither soldiers nor policemen at the gates, and,
moreover, the <i>concierge</i> was himself a convict!</p>

<p>"But," said I, "do not many of these fellows escape?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not many. Last month only sixteen ran away,"
was the <i>insouciant</i> answer of my guide.</p>

<p>From Poronai-buts to Sappro there is a small railway, by
which the coal trains are run to the coast as far as Otaru.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="small">Nearing Civilisation.</span></h2>


<p>Sappro, the present capital of Hokkaido, is a town of fairly
large size, with wide streets intersecting each other at right
angles. The Hokkaido-cho, a high red-brick building, the
law courts, the <i>Kofikan</i>, the palace built for the Emperor, and
used now as a kind of hotel, and the houses of officials, are
the main buildings of the place. There are, besides, a sugar
refinery, a hemp and silk factory, and a brewery, mainly
supported by the Government. Neither of the first two were
"flourishing industries," and one of the factories, if I remember
aright, had long ceased working, and the other was soon to
follow suit. The Government, I must say, have done their
best to encourage and push on industries as well as agriculture
in this district, but their efforts have produced but poor
results. Machinery, which had been imported at great
expense from England, America, Germany, and France, was
left to rust and perish, and no private company seemed ready
to continue the works. As a farming region the Sappro
district has also proved more or less a failure from a financial
point of view, though again the Government cannot but be
highly praised for the money they have spent in trying to
educate the people up to some kind of scientific, and therefore
paying, method of agriculture. They have a large model
farm of about 350 acres laid down in grain fields, as well as in
meadows and pastures, stocked with cattle imported mainly
from America. In the Toyoshira valley, south of the town, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
cattle farm is in full operation, but it yields the Government a
very poor return. However, the Government, I believe, only
wish to teach the people foreign ways of agriculture, and
expect no direct returns for the pains taken and the money
sunk&mdash;so at least it would appear. Another colonial militia
settlement is also found near Baratte, eight miles north of
Sappro. Regarding these settlements, it may prove interesting
to transcribe the Imperial Ordinance No. 181, dated August
28th, 1890, by which they were brought into existence and
the Tondens were built:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 1.&mdash;Colonial Militia shall be composed of colonial infantry,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Sappro was a civilised place compared to others I had seen
in Yezo; but it had neither the picturesqueness, nor the
strangeness, nor yet the interest of more uncivilised spots.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that savagery&mdash;when you have got
accustomed to it&mdash;is a great deal more fascinating than civilised
life, and infinitely more so than a base imitation of civilisation.</p>

<p>It might have been thought that after the months of privation
to which I had been subjected, after all the harassing
experiences I had gone through, after the accident which had
made the last thirty days of my journey so agonising, I should
have been glad to rest in this "London" of the Ainu country,
at least until I was well again. But in truth this indirectly
reflected civilisation worried me. The bustle of the people,
the lights in the streets, the sounds of the <i>Shamesen</i>&mdash;everything
annoyed me.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Governor, Mr. Nagayama, kindly called
on me, and when I put on some decent clothes which were
lent me, he drove me to his house, where I had a lengthy conversation
on the future of Yezo and the Kurile Islands. He
seemed to approve of many of the points which I put before
him, among which I suggested that the exports of sulphur
from Kushiro, on the south-eastern coast, would be greatly
increased if it were opened to foreign trade, and I was pleased
to hear several months later that a motion to that effect was
proposed in the Japanese Parliament. He also agreed with
me that Yezo needed roads and railways badly, and that when
more facile ways of communication should be established along
the coast and across country, then without doubt Yezo would
be rich and flourishing.</p>

<p>He expressed sorrow that emigration was not carried on
on a larger scale from the Southern Island of Japan, and
that private companies of capitalists in no way helped the
Government.</p>

<p>His Excellency was also kind enough to drive me round the
town and show me all the sights of Sappro, including the
small museum containing zoological specimens from Hokkaido,
and the implements of the Ainu and the Koro-pok-kuru. A
huge grizzly bear which had killed two babies and a man is
now stuffed, and occupies the first small room, while a bottle
by the side preserves in spirit the head and foot of one baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and some parts of the man which were found in its stomach
when captured and dissected.</p>

<p>I left Sappro for Otaru by the coal train. Otaru is situated
on a semicircular well-sheltered bay, which makes it the best
and only safe port on the western coast of Yezo.</p>

<p>The coast at the mouth of the Ishikari River curves gently
round, and is exposed to the north as far as Cape Shakotan.
Otaru is rapidly growing in importance, owing to the fact that
it is the nearest shipping port to the Poronai coal mines.
Unfortunately, three small hills, which were being levelled
when I was there, had greatly interfered with the first laying
out of the settlement, which accounts for the town being all
crooked and irregularly planned. It has the appearance of a
thriving place, and much resembles one of the small seaports
of Southern Japan. In the main street a go-ahead tailor had
written over his door the following inscription for the attraction
of foreign clients: "Tailor. New Forms of every country
shall be made here." The notice was tempting, and I went in
to request his services in furnishing me with "new forms," as
he called them, of English fashion; but to my great regret he
had come to an end of his stock of goods, and I had to be
contented with my "old forms," and go on as best I could
with what I had till I should reach Hakodate, where I had left
most of my baggage. At Otaru I left all my paraphernalia to
be shipped to Hakodate by the first ship calling, and I proceeded
by land on the north and then on the north-west coast.
I felt that, suffering as I still was, I should keep alive as long
as I kept moving, as long as I was distracted by new scenery
and new excitements. I felt that if I were left to myself, not
pitied or sympathised with, I should be able to drag on and
conquer in the end. There is nothing, it seems to me, that
makes people feel so ill or is so enervating as the sympathy
of friends and the verdict of a doctor. Among civilised people
nine out of ten do not know whether they are very ill or not
until the doctor pronounces his opinion, which shows that
many complaints would be scarcely felt at all if the patient did
not know the name of his malady, or if he had sufficient determination
as to prevent his physical pain from becoming a
moral one as well. We have a proof of this in hypnotism, by
which sicknesses of many kinds can be cured by impressing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the subject the belief that his body is perfectly free from
disease. Of course in this case it is a stronger will acting on a
weaker one, which, so reinforced, is able to overpower the
physical trouble. Again, I may be allowed to state that
savages and barbarians, though affected with horrid diseases
of all kinds, do not seem to suffer from them as much as we
do. If an Ainu man breaks his leg he does not think for a
moment of lying in bed for the regulation forty days; first of
all, because he has no bed to lie on; and next, because the confinement
and inaction would simply kill him. He may lie
down on the hard ground for two or three days, after which
time he crawls about as best he can until nature makes his
broken bone right again. He does not worry himself much
about it. Wild animals do the same. If, then, the Ainu, and
with them savages of other countries, do that, why should not
I, a human being like them, do the same?</p>

<p>Freed from the encumbrance of my baggage, I set off on a
good horse down the north coast, and moving from east to
west. My baggage now consisted of a crutch which I had
made for myself, a stick, a couple of Japanese <i>kimonos</i>, and
a few sketch-books.</p>

<p>The travelling was extremely slow, and I shall not dwell at
length on this part of my journey, for it has no interest in
connection with the Ainu, as I met with scarcely any. On
a practicable and pleasant track leading all across the hills
beyond Oshoro village, a lovely view of the cliffs between that
place and Yoichi, lying to the west, is to be had. In some
parts the scenery is really grand. Coming down on the other
side of the hill, Momonai and Kawamura, two fishermen's
villages of some importance, are passed, and further west,
through a picturesque and narrow entrance of rugged volcanic
rocks, is Yoichi, a large village, which was entirely burnt down
last year, but has since been built up again. The road to
Iwanai branches off at Kawamura, across the Shakotan peninsula.
This peninsula is partly volcanic, partly composed of
tertiaries, on which metal veins are found, especially along
the course of the Yoichi River.</p>

<p>About three miles from Yoichi a small flax factory was
being built as an experiment by a Mr. Tokumatz Kuroda, in
the employ of the Mitzui Company. Twenty-five miles further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
south-west of Yoichi is Iwanai. About ten miles from
Kawamura, at Hando, a black tumbledown shed, like a
haunted house, stands in the middle of the woods, and from
here the track again goes over a mountain. On the other
side is Iwanai. Five or six weeks previous to my arrival
a large fire had destroyed nearly the whole of the village, and&mdash;just
my luck again!&mdash;I had great difficulty in finding a place
in which to obtain shelter for the night.</p>

<p>From Iwanai the coast-line roughly describes a semicircle,
which is almost concentric with Volcano Bay on the south coast,
the distance between the two seas being about twenty or
twenty-five miles, so that it forms a kind of large peninsula
stretching towards the south, and widening considerably at its
most southern part on the Tsugaru Strait. The first two or
three miles from Iwanai were a pretty flat and easy track,
but then I struck the mountain trail, which was steep and
heavy for my pony. It was raining in torrents, and the
narrow track was literally turned into a running rivulet. By
good luck the rain stopped, and when I reached the summit I
had a glorious panorama of the brilliant rocks and cliffs of the
Shakotan Cape to the north-east, with the Kamui and the
Hurupira Mountains on one side, and the villages of Shiribets,
Isoya, and Karibayama along the coast on the other. I
descended into the valley and then went up again the next
mountain, the Iwaonobori, a higher peak than the first. I
went down its slopes on the other side in a zig-zag fashion,
and then came to the snake-like river called Shiribets, on
both sides of which a few fishermen's houses are found, forming
the Shiribets village.</p>

<p>Three miles further is a larger settlement, Isoya, the half of
which is called Notto Isoya, the other Shimakotan Isoya. It
is a long row of fishermen's houses scattered along the coast
until we get to Ushoro, eight miles further, a settlement of
120 houses.</p>

<p>Ushoro is connected by a road to Oshamambe, on Volcano
Bay, but I went on to Shitzo, four miles north-west of Ushoro.
The way was fairly good in some parts, and execrably
bad in others. The heavy rain which had again come on
was not exactly suited to my present state of health; moreover,
it swelled all the small brooks, which fell in a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of picturesque waterfalls over the high cliffs down on to the
beach. As the beach was narrow, this meant each time a cold
shower-bath, which, however, did not much matter, for I was
already drenched by the rain, and I had no very "swell"
garments to spoil, as my readers know.</p>

<span class="caption">AINU HALF-CASTE CHILD OF VOLCANO BAY.</span></div>

<p>Shitzo is an old-looking place, but there is nothing attractive
about it. It is in a small bay sheltered by Cape Benke, but
its anchorage is only fit for junks or very small skiffs. It is
much exposed to northerly and easterly winds. The coast
from Shitzo to the Cape is lined with rocky bluffs and cliffs of
conglomerate and volcanic formation, with bare hills inland.</p>

<p>There are many reefs stretching out, both along the coast
and off the Cape; but in many places channels are cut in
them, to all appearance produced by some remote volcanic
action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
On the western side of Cape Benke is the village of Masatomari.
There were formerly some Ainu villages on this part
of the coast, but hardly any natives are to be found now. The
few remaining have adopted to a certain extent Japanese
customs and manners.</p>

<p>At Baraputa I heard that it was impossible to continue my
journey south on horseback along the coast, for the track was
almost impassable, even on foot. It was a steep and difficult
trail over the mountains, among rocks and precipitous cliffs,
and I was quite unable to accomplish it; so I retraced my steps
to Shitzo, and from there struck across the peninsula on the
road for Oshamambe, on Volcano Bay. The road is a good
one, and when bridges are built where needed it will be practicable
for <i>bashas</i>, the four-wheeled vehicles of Southern Yezo.
The way is across mountains or among well-wooded hills.
Kuromatsunai is the largest group of houses found along the
road. It is about halfway between the two coasts.</p>

<p>Late at night, after having ridden twenty-five miles, I arrived
at Oshamambe, a semi-Ainu village on Volcano Bay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="small">Completing the Circuit of Yezo&mdash;The End of my Journey.</span></h2>


<p>Oshamambe is a group of seventy houses, just midway
between Mororran and Mori. The Ainu of this bay are poor
specimens of their race, as most of them have intermarried
with Japanese. They are, however, those most talked about
by Europeans, for they are of easy access to globe-trotters.</p>

<p>They are mostly half-castes, and even second and third
crosses; wherefore it is no wonder that the incautious travellers
who have written on the Ainu, studying only these
easily-visited specimens, have discovered in them a remarkable
likeness to the Japanese!</p>

<p>The fact that I was rapidly nearing the end of my trip half
filled me with pleasure, yet pleasure mingled with regret. It
was nearly six weeks now since I met with the accident to
my foot, and I was decidedly better. The cold weather had
greatly contributed to this improvement of my condition; and
had it not been for my bone which kept sticking out of my skin,
I should have considered myself in fine case. I could hop
along with my self-made crutch and my stick, and when riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the pain was not nearly as acute as it had been the first fifteen
or twenty days.</p>

<p>As the road was good, and there was nothing interesting to
me on this portion of the journey, I tried to push on rapidly
towards Mori. Unfortunately, at the last minute my patience
was put to a trial. I hired a horse, and it was lame. No
others were to be had that day for love or money. The
animal had been lame for two years, they said, and though
uncomfortable to ride he did not suffer any pain. This I
ascertained afterwards was true, for that day the sturdy brute
carried me 48½ miles without once requiring punishment. It
is needless to say that what I suffered that day by the continuous
jerking is beyond description. I rode fourteen hours
in a fearful storm of rain and snow, and my feverish anxiety
to reach Hakodate soon, so that I might receive letters, and
have news of my parents and friends&mdash;from whom I had
not heard for five months&mdash;helped me to pull through all the
fatigue and worry of the way. The road between Oshamambe
and Kunnui is fair, getting still better towards Yurap and
Yamakushinai. But to shorten the journey and lessen the
jerking I followed the sandy sea-beach, which, describing a
smaller circle than the road, necessarily diminishes the distance.
From Yamakushinai the road is very good and wide, and it has
nicely-built bridges over the Otoshibe and Nigori Rivers. The
small fishing villages, though not so imposing in appearance as
some of those in other parts of Yezo, add to the picturesqueness
of the bay, with its beautiful volcanic cone of Komagatage
towering in the distance towards the south-east.</p>

<p>The fishing in Volcano Bay consists mostly of mackerel,
sprats, halibut, and herrings.</p>

<p>I reached Mori late in the evening, and was received with a
friendly greeting by the people of the tea-house in which I had
stayed on my way up at the beginning of my journey.</p>

<p>The place was brilliantly lighted with numberless candles,
and opposite the entrance was a kind of altar decked with
flowers and cakes. A few <i>bonzes</i>, with their shaven heads and
long, thin, depraved fingers, were saying their prayers and
beating with a small wand on the round wooden bells. With
the gods of Japan you must ring a bell or clap your hands
before you begin to pray, or else the god will pay no attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to your petitions. In the next room another Japanese, with
less depraved fingers, but with a more wicked face, was dressed
in European clothes, and was apparently giving a sermon,
and sure enough he proved to be a native Christian minister!</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said I to the landlord; "what does all this
mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said he, smiling&mdash;for Buddhism teaches you not to
show pain&mdash;"my old mother is dead. You saw her when you
were here before. She died yesterday, and as she was formerly
a Buddhist and had become a Christian, I have now got some
Buddhist <i>bonzes</i> and a Christian minister to pray for her, for I
want her to be happy in the other world."</p>

<p>"But do you not think," I replied, "that so much praying
of different kinds might interfere with her happiness?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, your honourable," he said quickly, "I have paid
the <i>bonzes</i> and the clergyman in advance, and the gods cannot
get angry now!"</p>

<p>It was curious to notice the competition between the representatives
of the two different creeds.</p>

<p>On the one side the Christian shouted his prayers and sang
his hymns in a stentorian voice, to put the <i>bonzes</i> in the shade
and get the start of them in the contest; and on the other side
these rattled on the wooden bells with all their might, so that
their prayers should be heard first. I was more than happy
when this religious race was over, and I was allowed a few
hours' rest.</p>

<p>Instead of going straight to Hakodate by <i>basha</i> by the
road I had already once traversed, I followed the coast in a
south-easterly direction towards the volcano of Esan.</p>

<p>Near Usushiri, some two miles inland, are the hot springs
of Obune, where, in a picturesque gully surrounded by
mountains, are two dirty shanties for the benefit of those who
wish to take the waters. At Isoya, five miles north of this
place, similar springs are found, and three and a half miles
south-east of Usushiri still more can be seen at Kakumi. The
latter place is a picturesque little spot, with its three old sheds
and the steaming bath-room framed in the multi-coloured
foliage of trees with their lovely autumn tints. A clean path
a few hundred yards long leads from the coast to the springs,
and a track across the mountains is found between that place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and Hakodate; also another leading from Obune to the latter
port. By both these tracks a most lovely view of Hakodate
Bay can be obtained when the summit of the mountain range
is reached. From Kakumi the coast-line is wretched for
travelling, set thick as it is with stones as sharp as knives,
while the waves continually wash over the narrow beach,
drenching the wayfarer to the skin.</p>

<p>I reached Otatsube, a group of a few fishermen's huts; and
as there is no traffic whatever along this coast, there were
no regular tea-houses. Unfortunately for me, the British
Squadron in the Pacific had spent the summer at Hakodate,
and the ships had often gone for gun-practice somewhere near
this place, scaring the natives to death, and furthermore
angering them against foreigners in general, for they said the
report of the guns frightened away all the fish. When I
asked for food and offered money for it, they flatly refused
me, saying contemptuously,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You foreigners come and scare all the fish away, and now
you shall die of starvation before you shall get food from us.
We do not want your money. We are rich."</p>

<p>And so I was held responsible for the doings of Her
Majesty's fleet, which until then I did not even know had been
in those waters!</p>

<p>At Furimbé, the next small village, only a few miles further
on, my experience was even more unpleasant. Not only
would they not give me food, but they would not shelter me
for the night in any of the houses; and many of the fishermen,
taking advantage of my wretched condition, were impudent
to such a point that I thought we should have come
to blows.</p>

<p>It was getting quite dark, and I was fearfully hungry and
exhausted. The only course open to me was to push on, and
see if I could come across some other hut where the owners
were not so churlish. As it turned out, for the first time since
I had been in Hokkaido I had some good luck that night!</p>

<p>A few hundred yards from this Japanese village, among the
trees, was a little wooden shrine. Through the grating of the
door I caught sight of offerings of cakes and rice which the
religious fishermen had deposited on the kind of altar, probably
to appease the angry gods, and induce them to fill the sea with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
fish again. The door of the shrine, as is usual in country
places in Japan, was not locked, but a small outside bolt was all
there was to keep it closed. I had no difficulty in entering.
The night was a terrible one. The rain was pouring in
torrents, and having had nothing to eat all day, I felt I had
not the strength to go another yard. "After all," I said to
myself, "the home of the gods, Japanese or not, is good enough
for me. So is this supper," I soliloquized, swallowing now a
white cake, now a red one, then a green one, till nothing but
the empty vessels were left. "Delicious" was my last word,
when, smacking my lips over the last green cake, I proceeded
to make myself comfortable for the night. It is needless
to add that I left very early in the morning, when the
first rays of light broke the dimness of the night, and I dare
say that, for the sake of morality, I ought to add that I was
sorry for committing the sacrilege; but I was not&mdash;indeed
I was not!</p>

<p>The mountain track continued, rough and steep in many
places, and the autumn tints on the foliage were lovely, though
not as varied as those of Northern America. Past Todohotke
another volcano, the Esan, stared me in the face. Its crater,
or rather its craters, for there are several, are not on the
summit of the mountain, which is well rounded, but nearly
halfway down its western slopes. Accumulations of very
pure sulphur are deposited in and around these craters, and a
continuous rumbling can be heard inside the mountain. The
craters eject sulphurous vapours, and molten lava bubbles up
as if in gigantic caldrons, congealing at the mouths of the
craters and cracking with the extreme heat.</p>

<p>The coast-line is precipitous and almost impassable round
Cape Esan, therefore the track leads over the mountain. The
altitude of Esan is 1740 feet above the sea-level, but owing to
its rising directly from the sea it has the look of a much more
lofty mountain. Komagatage, near Mori, is 4,011, or more than
double the height of Esan, while Makkarinupuri volcano, or
Shiribeshi Mountain, as others call it, about forty-five miles
south-west of Sappro, and ten miles north of Toya Lake,
reaches an altitude of 6,440 feet.</p>

<p>Iwaonobori, which I passed on the north coast in this latter
part of my journey, is 3,374 feet. Usu, on Volcano Bay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
1868 feet. Tarumai, directly south of Sappro, only reaches a
height of 2,800 feet.</p>

<p>When this volcanic part of the coast round Esan Cape is
passed the track becomes easier and flatter. One comes again
to the sandy beaches, and the coast is lively with numbers of
fishermen's huts, and a couple of villages like Shirikishinai
and Toi. One day's journey on horseback from here takes
you to Hakodate. The Hakodate Peak can be seen in the
distance to the west; and only a few more hours, only a
few more miles, and I should be in civilisation, I should
see a few European faces, and I should hear English spoken
again.</p>

<p>As I approached the sandy isthmus, and the peak grew
bigger before me, I wondered what had been going on in the
world, and what news I should receive of my dear ones. I
imagined myself already devouring with my eyes the hundreds
of letters which must have been amassed at Hakodate, waiting
for me during the many months I had been away. I imagined
myself half buried in newspapers months old, anxiously reading
the news of the world. I hurried on my pony, I crossed
the sand isthmus&mdash;and there I was in the lively streets of
Hakodate, gazed at by the astonished Japanese, who, I
believe, were more than a little amazed&mdash;perhaps scandalised&mdash;at
my turn-out.</p>

<p>Such as I was, and before I went to the Japanese tea-house,
I called at the Consulate for my correspondence. Her
Britannic Majesty's representative, who knew me well enough,
was more than thunderstruck when I appeared before him in
such a strange attire. He was smoking a pipe, and he almost
let it drop, such was his surprise.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he feebly exclaimed, looking me all over
from head to foot. "Surely you are not Landor?" he said
when I told him my name.</p>

<p>"I believe I am," I answered, "and I have come to trouble
you for my letters."</p>

<p>"Oh, none have come; we have none," he said drily.</p>

<p>And now that I was not quite so well dressed as when I
had called on my arrival at Hakodate from Southern Japan,
he seemed anxious to see me off the premises as soon as
possible, I dare say for fear lest I should expire on his doorstep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
"But there <i>must</i> be some letters," I said, as I was sadly
leaving.</p>

<p>"No, there are none. Good-bye," he repeated.</p>

<p>The first glimpse of civilisation and of a civilised being was
certainly not a pleasing one. In a town where there are
hardly half-a-dozen British subjects, all told, I expected a
better reception than one which many would not bestow on a
beggar to a compatriot in a foreign country. Kindness costs
nothing, and I was asking no favour.</p>

<p>I left the place disheartened, but feeling that the pompous
official had made a blunder, unluckily at my expense.</p>

<p>Mr. Henson, in whose house I had left all my luggage,
greeted me with open arms. He was kindness itself, and very
different from the gold-collared gentleman of the Consulate.
I must say that I felt most uncomfortable when, after having
opened my trunks, I put on fresh clothes and boots; in fact,
such was the change from my late airy costume that I caught
a cold! I had now almost finished my self-imposed task. I
had made the whole circuit of Yezo, and been up all its
largest rivers, with the exception of that part of the western
coast which lies between Barabuta and Hakodate. It would
mean only a few more days of agony, and for the sake of
completing my journey I left Hakodate again the next
morning at 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> in a <i>basha</i> for Esashi, on the west coast.
The distance is fifty-seven miles, and we employed sixteen
hours in covering it. It was snowing when we crossed the
hills, and it was fearfully cold. Fortunately, the road is one
of the best in Hokkaido. Just in front of me sat a poor man
piteously ill with <i>kaki</i>. His body was dreadfully swollen and
his limbs were stiff. What the poor man must have suffered
in being shaken for so many hours is beyond description.
His lamentations were heartrending. He had come to
Hakodate in the hope of getting cured, and now he was
returning&mdash;to use his words&mdash;"to die near his home." When
we reached Esashi he was truly more dead than alive. He
was senseless, and had to be lifted up bodily and carried into
the house.</p>

<p>Esashi is a large place, and is one of the oldest towns in
Yezo. In front lies a small oblong island, with which various
wonderful tales of treasure are connected. Its harbour is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
unsafe, being exposed to all winds, and I was told that the
sea is always rough except during the months of July and
August. I believe that this is greatly due to the currents.</p>

<p>I went north to Kumaishi and Cape Ota, the most westerly
point of Yezo. About ten miles west of this cape is the
small island of Okushiri, peopled mostly by Japanese.</p>

<p>The track is tolerably fair for about twenty-four miles as far
as Kumaishi. It runs either along the beach or around clay
and conglomerate rocky points, occasionally over the cliffs
and through ravines. North of Esashi, along the Assap
River, is a good stretch of cultivable land; then the thickly-wooded
mountainous region begins again towards the north.</p>

<p>Kumaishi is said to be the best district for herring fishing
along that coast.</p>

<p>From Kumaishi to Kudo numerous reefs extend out at sea,
and small headlands afford a safe anchorage to junks. The
track is mostly on a rough coast backed by high and well-wooded
hills. Striking across the mountains, which rise sheer
from the sea, we come to Cape Ota, the most westerly point
of Yezo. From here the coast turns towards the north-east
as far as Barabuta; but as it was impossible for me to go on
horseback to that place, though only a few miles distant, I
turned back and returned to Esashi, then following the coast
towards the south to Matsumai or Fukuyama, one of the first
Japanese settlements established in Yezo, and formerly the
capital of the island. The coast is rugged and picturesque
from Esashi to the two villages of Kaminokumi and Shiofuki,
after which a mountain path leads to Ishisaki.</p>

<p>I found the Japanese on this coast most polite and honest,
and more like the "old Japanese" than the younger generations.</p>

<p>The cliffs on the south side of the Ishizaki River were
resplendent in beauty under the brilliant red and yellow light
of the setting sun. Oshima (or Large Island) could be seen on
the horizon in the distant south. Five miles further, across
a mountain track, I came to Cisango, and five more miles
beyond that place landed me at Haraguchi, two small fishing
villages, with houses resting on high posts and against the
cliffs, somewhat similar to the villages I found previous to
my reaching the Ishikari River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
After that are eight or ten miles of a monotonous hilly road,
where you do nothing but ascend and descend one small hill
after another, up and down a snake-like or a zig-zag path;
but when Eramachi is passed the track becomes much more
interesting, with its peculiar groups of rocks of all shapes
sticking out of the sea, and the long line of reef over which
the breakers roll foaming and thundering. From here by the
side of Oshima, another small island, "Koshima," is seen on
the horizon. Going south the coast gradually gets more and
more picturesque, with its pretty little fishing villages hidden
among the rocks and sheltered under the high cliffs. At
Neptka a good road leads over the cliffs to Fukuyama.</p>

<p>About a mile before the town is reached, from a high point
of vantage on the road, is a pretty peep of Benten Island, just
off the shore, with an old temple on it, and by its side a new
lighthouse. On the shore, a few yards from the road opposite
the island, a large rock is literally covered with hundreds of
stone images of Amida and different gods, and two <i>Torii</i>,
sacred emblems of Japan, are placed in front of it.</p>

<p>I descended the slope gently and reached Koromatsumai,
otherwise called Matsumai, or Fukuyama. It is a "dear old
spot," the most picturesque of all the towns in Hokkaido. It
is ancient, for one thing, while other places are modern&mdash;some
villages, indeed, only a year or two old, or even less. Thus
weather has toned down the light yellow colour of the new
wood, which is so offensive to the eye in a landscape, and is so
common in all Japanese villages of Yezo. Besides, Fukuyama
has pretty temples on the surrounding hills, and prettily-laid-out
gardens with tiny stone bridges, bronze lanterns, and
dwarfed trees. It is more like a town of old Japan. It has a
three-storied castle with turned-up roofs, as one sees on the
willow-pattern plates.</p>

<p>The castle, formerly the residence of the Daimio, a feudal
prince, is now a restaurant. The irregular streets of the town,
the narrow lanes, the houses blackened by smoke and age,
give a certain <i>cachet</i> which is peculiar to the place itself.
The inhabitants, too, are more conservative than the younger
colonists, and are quite "in keeping" with the place. Unluckily,
the town has seen better days! It possesses no
good harbour, and all its trade, little by little, is being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
carried away by its more fortunate rival, Hakodate. The
population of Matsumai decreases considerably every year, as
the inhabitants leave this poetical but dead-alive and decaying
spot for the more exciting life to be found in newly-opened
districts further east or north.</p>

<p>Between Fukuyama and Hakodate, a distance of over sixty
miles, the road is extremely bad, and there is nothing whatever
to see. Shirakami Cape is interesting as being the most
southern point of Yezo, and from here the coast turns slightly
towards the north-east.</p>

<p>Fukushima is an old village. The other headlands, and the
Cape of Yagoshi, have no special features calling for attention.
Near the latter cape the coast is volcanic, which renders it very
rugged in shape and warmly tinted in colour. There are
many villages along the coast, as Yoshioka, Shiriuchi, Kikonai,
Idzumizawa, Mohechi, and Kamiiro, and the inhabitants seem
well off and well-to-do people.</p>

<p>A great quantity of coal and firewood is carried on pony-back
from these mountains to Hakodate. Rows of ten, twelve,
or fifteen ponies one after the other, loaded with as much as
they can carry, can be seen slowly travelling, under the care of
one man, down to the principal port of Yezo, especially at the
beginning of the winter season; and here and there stacks of
split wood are piled ready for transportation.</p>

<p>Rounding the Hakodate Bay, I was again at the point whence
I had first started, and happy that, notwithstanding all the ill-luck
I had had, notwithstanding the strain on my physique,
which is not by any means herculean, and notwithstanding all
the obstacles which had come in my way, I had finally succeeded
in doing what no European had ever done before,
namely, in completing the whole circuit of Yezo at one time,
exploring all its most important rivers and lakes, studying the
habits, customs, and manners of that strange race of people,
the Hairy Ainu, and visiting the Kuriles besides.</p>

<p>Many parts which I travelled over had never been trodden
by European foot, and this made my journey all the more
interesting to me. As the book stands I have related but the
principal adventures which I had during my long peregrinations
in Hokkaido, most of which are intended to illustrate
Ainu customs and traits by my own personal experience rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
than to excite sympathy for my hardships. Really, though
the journey nearly cost me my life, I have never, in my
extensive wanderings, enjoyed a trip more than that to
Ainuland.</p>

<p>I have touched but slightly, and not more than was absolutely
necessary, on subjects relating to the Japanese; for this
is intended as a work on the Ainu.</p>

<p>I was happy yet sorry to be at the end of my journey!
This was the 146th day since I first left Hakodate, and the
distance I had travelled was about 4,200 miles, out of which
3,800 were ridden on horseback, or an average of twenty-five
miles a day. The remaining 400 miles were either by steamer
or canoe travelling.</p>

<p>From the day I broke the bone in my foot I travelled fifty-eight
days, mostly on horseback, and the first time it was
attended to and properly bandaged up was sixty days after it
occurred, or two days after my arrival in Hakodate, by Mr.
Pooley, chief engineer on board the <span class="smcap">ss.</span> <i>Satsuma Maru</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Henson was again extremely kind, and pressed me to
leave the tea-house and go and stay at his place, and after
five months of "hard planks" I slept again in a comfortable
bed. What a treat it was! What a curious sensation to sleep
in a bed again, and actually have sheets and blankets! But
this was not all, for surprise followed surprise.</p>

<p>The pompous Consul, who for the sake of saving himself
the trouble of looking into his desk, had made my last portion
of the journey wretched and sorrowful, found that after all
he was mistaken, and on the breakfast-table in my place I
found a packet of about 100 letters and newspapers, which the
Consul sent to me with a message saying that when I called
last time he had forgotten who I was, and therefore had forgotten
to give me my correspondence!</p>

<p>Now that we have travelled round and through the country
in every direction; now that we have seen where the different
tribes of Ainu are, I shall attempt to give my readers some

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="small">Ainu Habitations, Storehouses, Trophies, Furniture&mdash;Conservatism.</span></h2>


<p>Ainu architecture is by no means elaborate, let alone
beautiful; but though it is so simple, it is to a certain extent
varied, differing according to the exigencies of climate and
locality. Huts of one district vary from those of another not
only in small details, but also in the whole shape; or if the
shape is the same, the materials are different.</p>

<p>The principal characteristics of the Volcano Bay and Saru
River huts is, that they have angular roofs and are thatched
with tall reeds and arundinaria, while the huts up the Tokachi
River are more often covered with bark, though in form they
are almost identical with those others.</p>

<p>On the Kutcharo Lake, again, the huts are thatched with
tall reeds like those of Volcano Bay, but the building itself has
a totally different shape. The roof is semicircular, and each
hut is in appearance like the half of a cylinder lying on its
rectangular base.</p>

<p>On the north-east coast the huts have either roofs similar
to the Kutcharo ones, or else the angle is very obtuse instead
of being sharp, as with the Piratori or Volcano Bay huts.</p>

<p>In the Kuriles, at Shikotan, the Ainu have houses exactly
similar to those at Piratori.</p>

<p>Setting aside the varieties of form, we shall now consider
how the huts are built. A frame is first made by horizontally
lashing at short intervals long poles to others at the angles of
the roof. Often the roof is made first and lifted up bodily
on the forked poles on which it rests. Then long reeds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
arundinaria are collected in sufficient quantity to thatch the
frame thickly on each side. Other poles or rafters are then
placed over these reeds, and through them lashed tightly to
the under frame, thus preventing the thatch from being blown
or washed away. Care is taken to leave an opening for the
door; and the small east window&mdash;usually the only one in
Ainu huts&mdash;is cut out afterwards by means of a knife. Ainu
huts have never more than one storey and never more than one
room and a small porch. In districts where the climate is less
severe the porch is often dispensed with. In building their
habitations the hairy people make no attempt whatever at
symmetry or beauty; all they aim at is to make themselves a
shelter and nothing more.</p>

<p>There are no more professional architects than professionals
of any other kind in the Ainu country. Each man is his own
architect, builder, and carpenter. He may occasionally receive
the help of a neighbour when he is building his hut, if all
hands in the family are not sufficient to carry him through
his work.</p>

<p>Each family has its own hut, which is used day and night by
all the members. If one of the sons gets married he sometimes
brings his bride to live in his father's hut, or else he goes to
live in his bride's hut; but as the "hairy mother-in-law" is no
better than other "mothers-in-law," the end of this arrangement
is that generally the bridegroom has to build a habitation
for himself and his better-half. Fortunately for him, he has to
pay no ground-rent; nor has he to take a lease, nor pay the
lawyer for an agreement, nor yet to buy the ground nor the
materials on which and of which his not too luxurious abode
is to be built. He chooses the site which is most suitable to
him, and there he builds his hut as best he can; and no one is
any the worse or the wiser for it. The "furnishing" is a matter
of no consideration with the Ainu, as he prefers to live in an
"unfurnished house." By instalments, however, as he finds
his floor becoming rather damp, he provides himself with a
few rough planks, which afford him comfortable sleeping
accommodation; and during the winter, when fishing is not
practicable, and he spends most of his day at home, he roughly
carves for himself a moustache-lifter (the <i>Kike-ush-bashui</i>);
a small paddle, the <i>Hera</i> (which is used both to stir the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
wine and as an implement in weaving); a pestle and mortar
carved out of the trunk of a tree; and, if he be a very ambitious
person and fond of his wife, he will probably make her a
weaving loom as well as two or three "water-jugs" if we may
call them so&mdash;vessels made of bark bent into shape, and lashed
so strongly as to be water-tight, and used for carrying water
as needed.</p>

<p>A few wooden bowls, a wooden hook, which is suspended
over the fire when bear-meat is smoked, occasionally a <i>Kinna</i>
(a mat), and a skin or two, are all the articles of furniture of
Ainu manufacture which an Ainu can possess, though few of
them possess so many. The Ainu hut has a fire-place in the
centre, or rather, a fire is lighted in the centre of the hut. The
fire is lighted with a flint and steel&mdash;a method learned from the
Japanese&mdash;or by the friction of two sticks. The more civilised
Ainu have now adopted matches. A hole in the angle of the
roof acts as chimney, but unfortunately more in name than in
practice.</p>

<p>Chairs, stools, sofas, beds, tables, etc., are all things unknown
to the Ainu. While inspecting the hut it may be
as well to see how the weaving-loom, the most complicated
article of the Ainu household, is made and worked. There is
a "yarn beam" (the <i>Kammakappe</i>), on which the "warp" of
unwoven thread is wound and kept separated, and another
"roll" by which the warp threads in the process of weaving
are kept in tension between the two gratings. There then is
the <i>Poro-usa</i> (the "large grating"), through the intervals of
which the warp threads pass, and the <i>Usa</i>, a similar but smaller
grating placed on the other side of the roll.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-209.png" width="400" height="167" alt="WEAVING IMPLEMENTS." /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
The cloth is wound round a stick which rests on the lap of
the weaver, and is kept in tension by means of her wrists;
and at the same time the <i>Ahunkanitte</i> (the "shuttle"), is passed
between the two sets of warp threads carrying the transverse
thread, or "woof," from one side of the cloth to the other
and back again. This is then beaten up by means of a long
shuttle like a netting mesh, which first draws the weft into its
place, and is then used to beat it up. In some ways this form
of loom is similar to that of India. The "netting mesh" is
called <i>Atzis-Hera</i>. Finally, the <i>Pekoatnit</i> is a bi-forked instrument
for separating the threads.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-210a.png" width="400" height="53" alt="WEAVING IMPLEMENTS." /></div>

<p>It is needless to say that with this primitive and homemade
loom it takes a very long time to weave a very short
piece of cloth; but as time is not money with Ainu women,
and patience is one of their virtues, it answers their purpose,
and they wish for nothing better.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-210b.png" width="400" height="68" alt="ATZIS-CLOTH IN PROCESS OF WEAVING" />
<span class="caption">ATZIS-CLOTH IN PROCESS OF WEAVING.</span></div>

<p>The thread used for manufacturing the cloth is made of the
inner fibre of the <i>Ulmus campestris</i> bark. At the beginning
of the spring the elm bark is peeled off the trees and is put
in water to soak and soften until the inner fibres can be
separated, made into threads, and wound up round reeds.
The material woven from these threads is very coarse and
brittle, except in wet weather or when soaked in water, in
which case clothes made of it cannot be worn out.</p>

<p>The weaving is usually plain, but sometimes a simple
pattern of black parallel lines is woven in with the material.
The natural colour of the elm-fibre thread is dark yellow, and
the black lines are composed of the same thread stained.</p>

<p>The other contrivance in Ainu huts which strikes one as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
being simple but clever is the hook suspended over the fire.
The rope is passed over a rafter. One end of it is fastened to
the hook, the other, as shown in the illustration, to
a piece of wood through which the hook has previously
been passed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/illus-211.png" width="83" height="282" alt="ROASTING HOOK" title="" />
<span class="caption">ROASTING HOOK.</span></div>

<p>Mat-making is closely allied to weaving, and is
worked entirely on the same principle, but without
the aid of any kind of machinery. The bulrushes
are crossed and woven coarsely, and plaited flat.
One of these mats is used in Ainu huts as a door&mdash;"the
<i>Apa Otki</i>." A smaller one is hung over or by
the window.</p>

<p>Naturally, Ainu huts are somewhat draughty.
The imperfectness of the door and window-fittings,
the large outlet for the smoke, besides the wind
which finds its way through the thatched walls,
make Ainu dwellings "ideal" to anyone wishing to "catch
his death of cold." The Ainu do not much mind it.</p>

<p>The roof is low, and from it hang the winter provisions of
dried salmon captured during the autumn. This gives an
additional odour to the already strong scent of the hut&mdash;an
"ancient fish-like smell," not redolent of the perfumes of
Arabia. The smoke inside the hut is so dense when there
happens to be a fire burning that one's eyes stream with
involuntary tears, and one is nearly choked. When the days
are short in winter the Ainu sometimes light their dwellings
with a stick to which is fastened a piece of animal fat. It is
hung up aloft, and when the lower end is lighted the fat slowly
melting serves to feed the flame and keep this primitive lamp
alight. Another mode of illumination is by firing a lighted
piece of birch bark on a stick previously split at the upper
end. The third way is by filling a large shell with fish-oil
and burning in it a few strings of elm-fibre. None of these
methods come much into use for everyday life, as, unlike the
negroes, the Ainu are not fond of sitting up at night, except
on extraordinary occasions; and when by chance they do sit
up it is by the light of the fire only.</p>

<p>If a stranger stops for the night in an Ainu hut, he is made
to sleep directly under the east window; but the family take
good care to sleep all together on the north side, which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
most distant point from the door and the window. Occasional
callers are received on the side nearest to the door.</p>

<p>The few Ainu who possess mats on which they sit during
the day hang them up at night round the hut, probably to
protect themselves from the liberal ventilation, which even
those who are used to it find trying when a gale is blowing or
the thermometer is very low.</p>

<p>There is no particular spot inside the hut set apart for
meals, and the refuse is either thrown into a corner of the hut
or flung outside the door and left there. It is difficult to say
whether the inside or the outside of an Ainu hut is the dirtier.
Heaps of stinking refuse are accumulated round the dwellings,
and in summer-time these heaps are alive with vermin&mdash;mosquitoes,
flies, <i>abu</i>, and black-flies. It is quite sufficient to move
a step from the door to see a cloud of these noxious insects
rise, and each one of them will have a bite at you.</p>

<p>Inside the house you are no better off. <i>Taikki</i> (fleas) are
innumerable, and of all sizes, not to mention other well-known
but usually anonymous enemies of the human skin.</p>

<p>The first night I slept in an Ainu hut, though I was provided
with insecticide powder, I was literally covered with
bites. With my fondness for statistics I proceeded to count
them, and only from my ankle to my knee I counted as many
as 220. The rest of my body and my head were covered in
the same proportion, but I gave up the attempt to ascertain
the exact number&mdash;the task was too overwhelming. My skin,
however, got so inflamed by these bites as to produce fever,
which lasted two or three days. After that time I never again
suffered to such an extent, perhaps owing to the fact that no
free spot was left to attack, or may be from that curious process
called acclimatisation.</p>

<p>The Ainu huts are built entirely above ground, and are
used alike in winter and summer.</p>

<p>In olden times the hut was always destroyed at the death
of its owner, or when abandoned; but in the former case the
custom is seldom practised now, and in the latter they are
merely left to decay.</p>

<p>It is singular that migrating Ainu, coming across an
uninhabited hut, never live in it, but build a new one for
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
The Kurilsky Ainu until quite recently destroyed their
huts when migrating from one island to another. They also
burnt the huts of deceased persons. It is needless to say that
the Ainu have no churches, no hotels, no hospitals, and no
public buildings of any kind. The huts in villages are a little
way from one another, and each hut has directly in front a
separate storehouse, built on piles or posts so as not to be
accessible to wolves, dogs, or rats. These are small structures,
the architecture of which has the local characteristics of the
habitations, with the exception that they are invariably on
piles, while the habitations are on the ground. Clothes, furs,
mats, and winter provisions of sea-weed are kept in these
storehouses, and access to them is by means of a peculiar
ladder. It is a mere log of wood, six or seven feet in length,
pointed at one end, and with five or six incisions, which serve
as steps, and remind me of the steps cut by an ice-axe in a
glacier or on frozen snow. Natives go up and down these
ladders with ease, even when carrying heavy weights on their
heads; and good care is always taken to remove the ladder
when leaving the storehouse. Women principally look after
these storehouses, and seem to have the whole care and
control of them. I have often seen an Ainu girl&mdash;for a storehouse
could hardly hold more than one&mdash;sitting on the tiny
door working at her lord and master's <i>Atzis</i> robe. Hour after
hour I have seen her sitting there, working patiently till the
sun has set and the darkness has come. Her materials were
then stowed away; the mat at the door was let down; the
ladder descended and kicked away; and sadly singing in her
soft falsetto voice, she retired into the dirt and dark of her
habitation.</p>

<p>The storehouses stand about six feet above the level of
the ground, and are generally on four, six, or eight piles.
Upon each pile is placed a large square piece of wood
turned downwards at the sides, so as not to be accessible
to rats and mice. Upon these square pieces of wood rest
horizontally four rafters, forming a quadrangle about eight
feet square. The small storehouse has as a base this quadrangle,
and is seldom high enough to allow of an adult to
stand inside.</p>

<p>Storehouses are thatched like all other houses. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the upper Tokachi, however, they are covered with the bark
of trees.</p>

<p>Next in connection with Ainu habitations comes the skull-trophy
at the east end of the hut. This is on a parallel line to
the hut wall, and only a few yards away from it, and is made
of a number of bi-forked poles, upon which are placed the
skulls of the bears, wolves, and foxes killed by the owner of
the hut. The Ainu is proud of this trophy, and if the number
of bear skulls is very large, he commands a certain amount of
respect from his hairy brethren. There is nothing that Ainu
admire more than courage, and there is nothing in the world
that an Ainu desires more than to be thought brave. When
he has gained this character a man becomes in a certain way
the "lion" of the village. He embellishes his trophy with a
<i>Nusa</i> and <i>Inaos</i> (willow wands with overhanging shavings&mdash;<i>see</i>
<a href="#Page_281">Chapter on Superstitions</a>), and he always looks on
it as an evidence of his manly glory. Besides this, many
Ainu possess one or two live bears kept in cages. Bear
hunters often secure one or more cubs, which they bring home
and allow to live in the hut like one of the family or an Irishman's
pig. These cubs are nursed along with and in the same
manner as the children, and Ainu say that women often put them
to the breast and suckle them like their own infants. Whether
this is true or not I cannot say; but though I have never seen
it, and therefore cannot vouch for it, it is not unlike Ainu
women to do such a thing.</p>

<p>When the new-comers grow big and powerful enough to be
dangerous, the men make a rough cage with logs of timber,
<span class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/illus-214.png" width="100" height="176" alt="THE APE-KILAI, OR EARTH-RAKE, AS USED BY PIRATORI AINU" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE APE-KILAI, OR EARTH-RAKE, AS USED BY PIRATORI AINU.</span></span>
placing them one over the other in a quadrangular
shape, and lashing them strongly
together. The bear is driven into the cage,
which is then roofed over; and after a couple
of years of confinement, during which it is
fattened, poor Bruin is killed for a bear festival.
In the lower part of the cage there is a small
wooden tray by which food is served to the
captive.</p>

<p>On the north-east coast of Yezo I have also
seen smaller cages, in which foxes, eagles, or other animals
are kept; and I always noticed the care which Ainu took to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
feed up the imprisoned animals. That "charity begins at
home" is true even among the hairy people; for if they are
kind to animals it is only for the sake of making a good meal
of them on the first occasion that presents itself.</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 37px;">
<img src="images/illus-215a.png" width="37" height="300" alt="PESTLE" title="" />
<span class="caption">PESTLE.</span></span>
<span class="figright" style="width: 119px;">
<img src="images/illus-215b.png" width="119" height="300" alt="MORTAR" title="" />
<span class="caption">MORTAR.</span></span>
It may be as well to state that
the Ainu have never been known
to make pottery. What they have
of the kind is imported and sold to
or exchanged with them by the
Japanese. If I were an Irishman
I should say that real Ainu pottery
is made of wood. Nevertheless,
large shells are often used by them
as drinking vessels where wooden
bowls are not obtainable. It is a
common occurrence in Ainu households
that one bowl is used by
several individuals, and a more
common occurrence still that none
of the bowls are ever washed or
cleaned after having been used.</p>

<p>The small Ainu porch which
stands frequently at the entrance of Ainu huts
answers the purpose of a stackhouse, and in it is
stored the firewood used in the house. The wooden
mortar and the long pestle are kept in a corner
under the porch. In the more civilised parts of
Yezo these pestles and mortars are general, as the natives
use them for pounding millet.</p>

<p>The pure Ainu live principally on animal food&mdash;fish and
meat&mdash;sea-weed, and some kinds of roots and herbs, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
they find on the mountains. Metallurgy is utterly unknown
to the Ainu. Until of late years they possessed nothing made
of metal. Their arrows had bamboo or bone heads; tin or
iron cooking utensils they had none; and the blades of their
knives were and are of Japanese origin. Some of these blades
are very old, and were acquired by the Ainu in the battles
which they fought against the Japanese; others have been got
by barter-metal exchanged for skins of animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-215c.png" width="400" height="136" alt="KITCHEN IMPLEMENTS" /></div>

<p>Furthermore, save the weaving-loom, the Ainu possess no
machinery of their own make. This too, as we have seen, is
but a very rude and simple kind of machine. The application
of wind or water power to economise human labour is in no
way known to them; thus they have no windlasses, no pumps,
no bellows, no windmills, no waterwheels; neither have they
any signs of the rudest form of machinery moved by manual
power which they have imagined and made for themselves.
Furthermore, they are very loth to accept those mechanical
means of economising labour which are employed by their
neighbours the Japanese.</p>

<p>The Ainu are very conservative, little as they may have to
preserve. They show a great dislike to change or reform their
habits and customs, or to improve themselves in any way.
Worse they could certainly not be. They have no ancestral
attachment which makes them unwilling to discard their rude
practices for more civilised ways; but, acting according to
their instincts, and not by their intelligence, they preserve
customs which seem inconvenient and unpractical to us, which
habit has rendered familiar and pleasant to them.</p>

<p>Various natives in other parts of the world show signs of an
earlier state of civilisation, but the Ainu do not. They have
never had a past civilisation, they are not civilised now, and
what is more, they will never be civilised. Civilisation kills
them. As a hog delights in filth, so the Ainu can only live in
dirt, neglect, and savagery of personal habits. They are made
that way, and they cannot help it. They are excluded from
progress by an impassable barrier. They have many miseries
in their life, but no greater misery could befall an Ainu than
to be forced to lead a civilised existence. Even after they
have been educated in Japanese schools, when they return
home, in a short time they forget all they have learned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
discard their acquired civilisation for the old, free, untrammelled
mountain life; the wild habits of the woods and sea-shore;
the nakedness of summer and the stifling squalor
of the one small dingy hut in winter; the uncombed hair
and matted beard; the putrid flesh of salmon, and the
vile compound they revel in till they get gloriously drunk
and bestial.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="small">Ainu Art, Ainu Marks, Ornamentations, Weapons&mdash;Graves and
Tattoos.</span></h2>


<p>The expression of ideas by graphic signs is utterly unknown
to the Ainu. They have no alphabet, and furthermore, they
have no methods whatever of writing. Hence the utter incapacity
of the hairy people to record events, time, or circumstances
in their history; for even the system of picture-writing
is not known to them.</p>

<p>Thus they have neither graven records nor any form of
visible history; and tradition transmitted from mouth to
mouth is all they have by way of historic continuity. The
nearest approach made to graphic signs is in the owner's
marks, which we occasionally find on some of their implements.
The moustache-lifter is the article on which this mark
is most commonly found. What these marks are meant to
represent I do not know for certain; but I believe that
Fig. 1 is supposed to convey the idea of a house, and Fig. 2
that of a boat; Fig. 3 a bear cage, and 4 the mere result of
fancy. Even these marks are only rarely found, and have
probably been suggested by Japanese writing.</p>

<p>The illustration shows the four specimens which I found
carved on moustache-lifters.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus-218b.png" width="250" height="73" alt="SYMBOLS" title="" /></div>

<p>Closely allied with writing is,
of course, map-drawing and
ornamentations. Map drawing
can be dismissed at once, like
that famous chapter on snakes in Iceland, as the Ainu know
nothing of it.</p>

<p>Rough ornamentations on bone and wooden implements
are their only artistic efforts. Truthful representations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
figures and animals are seldom attempted,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but conventionalised
symbols, suggested by and based on certain forms of
animal or vegetable life, are occasionally used for ornamentation.</p>

<p>The Ainu have no rock-sculptures, and can neither paint
nor draw in any form; what they have are mere simple wood-carvings.
But only a few have any aptitude for even this
crude work, though of course they are not all alike. As with
us we have people who are artistic and people who are Philistine,
so with the Ainu, in that very humble degree which is to
Western art what an acorn is to an oak.</p>

<p>Like all early work, Ainu art&mdash;if we may call it so&mdash;aims at
a certain uniformity, especially in leaf-portraiture, so as to
produce a somewhat symmetrical pattern; for at all times
geometry has been the mother of design.</p>

<p>An Ainu does not go for his models direct to Nature,
neither does he servilely copy his neighbour's work; but he
gets his ideas indirectly from both these sources, and through
inability to copy accurately, negligence in close study, and
some amount of native imagination combined, varies the
design which he has seen to such an extent as to make it
in a sense original. The talent shown by different men in the
art of carving varies considerably, even in men of the same
tribe; while certain tribes show both aptitude and fondness
for these ornamentations, whereas others have little of either.</p>

<p>It is the Ainu of the upper Ishikari River who chiefly excel
in these carved ornamentations. The knife represented in the
illustration comes from Kamikawa, and was carved with the
point of a knife by the chief of the Ainu there. It took the
man many months to accomplish, and it is by far the best
specimen of Ainu workmanship that I saw in Yezo, though
the ornamentations on it are not purely Ainu in character.</p>

This man was a genius as compared to other Ainu, and his
ideas of form and precision were considerably more developed
than in most of his race. He has ornamented the sheath with
conventionalised symbols, which were apparently suggested to
him by leaves and branches of trees; and the suggestion of
a flower can be noticed in the upper part of the handle. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
suggestion of fish-scales has been used by him to fill up small
open spaces; others he filled up with parallel lines. The
sheath is made of two parts, to allow the carver to
cut the space for the blade inside; but these two
parts are well fitted together, and kept fast by six
rings of neatly-cut bark fastened on while fresh, so
that by shrinking the two sides of the sheath are
brought close together, and are as if made of one
single piece.</p>

<p>The side view of the same knife shows the clever
contrivance for fastening it on to the girdle without
removing the latter from around the body. This knife
may be ranked among the <i>chefs d'œuvre</i> of Ainu art.</p>

<p>The principal characteristics of the more usual
ornamentations are interesting to study.</p>

<p>Art of course is only the personification, so to
speak, the expression of the mind, character, and
knowledge of the artist; thus, in Ainu ornamentations
we have patterns which could be nothing but
Ainu, taken collectively, yet which show distinctly
the temperament of each individual. For instance, taking
<span class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-220b.png" width="400" height="388" alt="" />
<span class="caption">KIKE-USH-BASHUI, OR MOUSTACHE-LIFTERS.</span></span>
the moustache-lifters (Figs. 1, 2, 4 in the illustration).
Fig. 1, with its roundish, undecided, lines, was carved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
a man weak in physique and <i>morale</i>; Fig. 2, which is much
simpler and with more decided lines, was the work of a quiet
but strong and proud man; and Fig. 4, with its coarse incisions,
was the outcome of a brutal mind.</p>

<p>Ainu designs, though slightly varied by each individual, are
principally formed of simple geometrical patterns; then of coils
<span class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-221a.png" width="300" height="224" alt="" title="SUGGESTIONS OF LEAVES" />
<span class="caption">SUGGESTIONS OF LEAVES.</span></span>
and scrolls; and, rarest of all,
because the highest attainment
of all, of conventionalised representations
of animal or vegetable
forms. Of the representations
from animal forms the
fish-scale is the only one adopted
by the Ainu, but suggestions
of leaves may not infrequently
be found in these designs. Some
of these are long and narrow; others are short and stumpy.</p>

<p>The above are, to my mind, the models which the Ainu
have chiefly taken for their leaf patterns, following nature at a
long distance indeed!</p>

<p><span class="figright" style="width: 163px;">

<span class="caption">ROPE-PATTERN AND
SIMPLE BANDS.</span></span>
Beside these, and much more common,
are the rope-pattern and the simple bands.
Often the rope-pattern has bands above
and below, especially in drinking vessels.</p>

<p>Triangles filled with lines parallel to one of the sides are

<span class="caption">TRIANGLES.</span></span>
frequently met with in moustache-lifters, and
occasionally the annexed patterns are found:
but as a rule the Ainu are not fond of merely
straight single lines except for "filling" purposes.
These patterns are mostly used on
their graves. In articles of every-day use they prefer curves
as a foundation of their ornamentations. The lozenge
<span class="figright" style="width: 223px;">
<img src="images/illus-221d.png" width="223" height="75" alt="CHEVRONS" title="" />
<span class="caption">CHEVRONS.</span></span>
pattern, especially one lozenge inside
the other, is a favourite among
their geometrical designs; also contiguous
and detached circles, chevrons,
double chevrons, and triple
chevrons. The chevrons are mainly
used by them on their graves, and they are invariably
enclosed between two or four lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
The two following patterns are elaborations of the foregoing,
but are much more uncommon.</p>

<span class="caption">ELABORATIONS OF
CHEVRONS.</span></span>
The parallel incised lines and parallel
lines crossing each other at right
angles are met with again and again
in Ainu patterns. More common still
is the occurrence of a number of parallel lines meeting
perpendicularly another lot of parallel lines without crossing
them.</p>

<span class="caption">A COMMON
PATTERN.</span></span>
Parallel lines have a fascination for the
Ainu, as we find them in most of their
designs.</p>

<p>Concentric circles are not often met with, neither is the
plain or loop coil often found, owing to the difficulty of

execution; but the wave pattern and double
wave are typical Ainu patterns; also the
reversed wave.</p>

<p>From these may have been derived the

of which is a mere
double reversed coil.</p>

<p>Triangular marks are occasionally

<span class="caption">FRETS.</span></span>
"put in" by the Ainu in some of
their more complicated designs, and
finally we find that, though rarely, they
sometimes attempt a kind of fret.</p>

<p>Other strange forms of lines which
are thoroughly characteristic of the
Ainu are the following.</p>

<p><span class="figright" style="width: 198px;">

<span class="caption">OTHER CHARACTERISTIC
DESIGNS.</span></span>
I never came across any Ainu wood-carvings
that were coloured, but in
bone-carvings&mdash;which, I must add, are
very rare&mdash;black is used to assist shade,
and bring out the higher lights by
contrast. The Ainu have no idea of
tones, semi-tones, or gradations; the
contrast is merely between the strong
black and strong white. Enamelling
is not known by them.</p>

<p>The objects which bear these incised ornamentations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
beside the sheaths and handles of their knives and swords and
their moustache-lifters, as has been shown, are the <i>Tchutti</i>,
or war-clubs; the <i>Hera</i>, or netting-mesh used in weaving;
drinking-vessels, quivers, pipes and tobacco-boxes, the
thread-reeds, cloth-hangers, and graves.</p>

<p>The modern Ainu are not a warlike people, therefore many
of the weapons which were used in former days for defence
and offence are rarely found now. For instance, the old war-clubs
are not used by the present generation. These clubs
were long and heavy, and were carried on the wrist by a piece
of rope passed through a hole at the upper end. Some were
plain and straight, others were curved towards the end to
<span class="figright" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/illus-223a.png" width="246" height="143" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">TCHUTTI, OR WAR-CLUBS.</span></span>
make them heavier. Now and
again some carved all over are
found. Pieces of leather or rope
were often knotted round the
heavier part to make the blow
more severe. In some of the
very old clubs a stone was inlaid
to add to the weight and consequent
efficiency of the weapon.
These clubs are from two to two and a half feet in length,
and are made of hard wood.</p>

<p>Ainu bows are simple, and not very powerful. They are
about fifty inches in length, and made of only one piece of
yew. The arrows, which are poisoned, are of bamboo or bone.
The poison is extracted from aconite roots mixed with other
ingredients. It is somewhat greasy owing to certain fatty
<span class="figleft" style="width: 157px;">
<img src="images/illus-223b.png" width="157" height="23" alt="TROUGH IN WHICH RESIN IS KEPT FOR FIXING ARROW-POINTS" title="" /><span class="caption">TROUGH IN WHICH
RESIN IS KEPT FOR
FIXING ARROW-POINTS.</span></span>
matters which it contains, and is smeared
into the cavity in the arrow-point, which
has previously been treated with pine-tree
gum to fix the poison. The arrow-point
is barbed, and so fashioned that when the
shaft is drawn from the wound this poisoned point remains.</p>

<p><span class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus-223c.png" width="250" height="83" alt="POISONED ARROWS" title="" />
<span class="caption">POISONED ARROWS.</span></span>
The illustration gives two
different kinds of poisoned
arrows. In Figs. 2 and 3, the
black part in the point shows
the cavity filled with poison.
Fig. 2 shows how the arrow-head is separated from the reed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and how when the arrow is drawn from the flesh the poisoned
point remains inside the wound.</p>

<p>The arrows, when in war or hunting, are kept in a quiver,
and a small <i>Inao</i> is hung to it to bring good luck to the
owner.</p>

<p>Spears and harpoons of one barb are common, and some of
the poisoned spears have heads similar to the arrows but of
a larger size. Spears are out of date now, but harpoons are
still employed in fishing.</p>

<p>Knives are the weapons on which a modern Ainu most
relies. Some of these knives are of such length that they
might pass for swords. The blade is single-edged, and is protected
by a wooden sheath. Nearly every man possesses one,
which he carries in his girdle when dressed; when naked, he
carries it in his hand. The illustration shows knives of
different sizes, and with different patterns worked on them.
From an artistic point of view the sheaths of knives are the
most carefully wrought over, and ornamented to a greater
extent than any other article of Ainu manufacture.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">AINU KNIVES.</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Then come the graves. The Ainu are very jealous of these
places of eternal rest, and good care is taken to hide them
either in the midst of a forest, on a distant and almost inaccessible
hill, or in some remote spot, difficult to find or reach.</p>

<p>Each village has its own semi-secret graveyard, in which all
its dead are buried. Occasionally, when the site of a graveyard
has become known to others than these local Ainu, the place
is deserted, and a fresh place of sepulture is chosen. The
manner of burial is as follows. The body, wrapped up in a
<i>Kinna</i> (mat), is fastened to a long pole and carried to the
grave by two men. All the villagers follow, each carrying
some article which was owned by the deceased. A grave is
dug, wide and long enough to hold the body laid flat. In it
are placed the bow and arrows with their quiver, the knife&mdash;from
which, for the sake of economy, the blade has been previously
removed&mdash;and the drinking-vessel which belonged to
the deceased, if he were a man. Women are usually buried
with some beads, earrings, and furs. All these articles, carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
by the mourners, are broken before they are laid in the grave
with the corpse; a few boards are then placed over the body,
and earth is thrown over these till the ground is level again.</p>

<p>The grave is generally so shallow that the body is only a
few inches underground&mdash;sometimes not more than four
inches. The body lies flat on its back. Close to its head is
erected a monument. For men it is the trunk of a tree,
about six feet in length, from which the bark has been peeled
off, and whereon certain ornamentations are cut. A short
branch is left on one side. The top of the tree-trunk and the
end of the branch are cut either in the shape of a lozenge, a
hexagon, or a semicircle; and a hole is made through it. At
the branch end, the cloth-earrings or the head-gear of the
deceased are hung and left to decay.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-225.png" width="600" height="530" alt="MONUMENTS OVER GRAVES." /></div>

<p>Women have simpler graves; they are flat instead of round,
and are cut into the shape of a canoe-paddle. The chief of a
village has a more elaborate tomb than others if he has been
liked by the villagers. At Raishats, on the Ishikari River,
I saw a really imposing monument put over the grave of
the chief who had recently died. It was of very large size,
and well carved&mdash;in the same patterns as those shown in
the illustration. Its chief peculiarity was that the body,
instead of being covered by earth, was covered by what
appeared to be a canoe or "dug-out" turned upside down,
the bottom of which had been laboriously carved. On each of
the two sides, at the head and foot of the grave, was stuck into
the ground a wooden blade twenty-one inches in length, resembling
<span class="figleft" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/illus-226.png" width="296" height="67" alt="WOODEN BLADE" title="" />
<span class="caption">WOODEN BLADE.</span></span>
in shape the
blade of a sword. Each
of these four blades was
carved alike, and had a
strange design resembling
the number 88. Whether a meaning is attached by the Ainu
to this design I cannot say, and the curious circumstance,
as my readers will remember, through which I came into
possession of one of these blades, did not permit me to
ask many questions on the subject. I often wondered
whether it meant that life begins, goes its way round, and
ends where it began? It is more likely, though, that no
meaning whatever is attached to those lines, for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
deep thoughts would hardly harmonise with the Ainu
philosophy&mdash;such as it is. The Ainu do not stop to mourn
or pray or trouble themselves about a grave when the body is
once buried. Those who have touched the body wash their
hands in a tub of water which has been brought for the
purpose; afterwards the water is thrown over the grave and
the tub is smashed. The Ainu seldom visit their graveyards
except when some one has to be buried. They hate their
dead to be disturbed, and nothing makes them more angry
than to know that a stranger has been near their burial-ground.
When a man is dead they try to forget all about
him and his doings, in which they generally succeed to perfection.
This naturally is not conducive to anything like
continuity in the history of the country, and may partly
account for their having none. Moreover, none of the tombs
bear the name or the mark of the person to whom it was
erected. Tombs of children are of similar shape to those of
adults, only smaller in size. When carrying the dead&mdash;or, as
we should say, going to a funeral&mdash;the Ainu put on their best
clothes, and when the burial is over they all get helplessly
drunk to make up for the loss of the departed friend.</p>

<p>To leave this somewhat grim subject and to return to
every-day art, it may be well to mention that the designs for
embroideries differ in no way from the wood-carvings. They
are often more accurately finished, owing to the greater facility
of materials, but the lines and all the characteristics of the
patterns are the same. In the tattoos the lozenge pattern
and bands are the two more commonly used. The Egyptian
cross is sometimes met with (<span>
<img src="images/illus-egyptiancross.png" width="15" height="15" alt="Egyptian Cross" />
</span>), and also a kind of reversed
<i>fylfot</i>, or <i>svastika</i>. Moreover, the St. Andrew's cross with
an additional line is not uncommon(<b>X|</b>). In the present
volume this is all I have to say on Ainu art. I may, however,
add that their ornamentations could not be more primitive, but
their frequency on weapons, clothing, implements, and graves
shows us that art, though not understood by the Ainu, has a
certain fascination, which, in their ignorance, they cannot
explain. They know art without knowing what art means.
Certain lines and simple designs which are familiar to them
appeal to their taste, else they would not ornament all their
articles with them. But this does not show any great intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
activity, for beyond that point the Ainu brain cannot
go. As art in its natural state is merely the pictorial outcome
of what the brain has grasped, we have in these crude
beginnings another strong proof that the brain-power of the
Ainu is indeed very limited, and their inability to represent
animal form seems extraordinary in view of what other
savages have done; but of course superstition may have
something to say to the omission. The Ainu rank very low
in the scale of civilisation; they are probably below the
Australian blacks and the tree-dwellers of India, who are
supposed to be among the lowest races in creation. The
Terra del Fuegians and certain African tribes run them hard;
but, taken all in all, the Ainu are the furthest behind in the
great race of human development.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="small">Ainu Heads, and their Physiognomy.</span></h2>


<p>The faces of the Ainu are far from ugly, and their heads are
singularly picturesque, though of course there are the finer
types as there are the meaner; by which we come to gradation
and comparison. The general idea that all Ainu are hideous
has arisen from the accounts of the few who have travelled in
the more civilised parts of Yezo, and have seen and studied
only a limited number of half-breeds and actual Japanese,
mistaking them for Ainu. In one of the last publications on
the Ainu, photographs of Japanese and half-breeds are given as
typical specimens of the Ainu race; and one or two real Ainu
are given as phenomena and exceptions. That the Ainu are
disgustingly filthy is undoubted; that in many ways they are
monkey-like is certain; but also that on a close examination
many are not devoid of good features is undeniable. As regards
looks, it is a great mistake to compare savages with
ourselves, and to judge of them from our own standpoint.
This is no more fair than to compare a thoroughbred fox-terrier
with a thoroughbred poodle-dog, to the disadvantage of
the one or the other. Passing off half-breeds as pure types of
course makes things ten times worse, and complicates matters
for those who care for accuracy, and are interested in anthropological
researches.</p>

<p>Ainu physiognomy is an interesting study. When seen full-face
the forehead is narrow, and sharply sloped backward. The
cheek-bones are prominent, and the nose is hooked, slightly
flattened, and broad, with wide, strong nostrils. The mouth is
generally large, with thick, firm lips, and the underlip well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
developed. The space from the nose to the mouth is extremely
long, while the chin, which is rather round, is comparatively
short and not very prominent. Thus the face has the
shape of a short oval. The profile is concave and the mouth
and eyebrows are prominent, though of course the nose projects
more than the lips, yet without being too markedly
projecting. The chin and forehead recede, as has been said,
and in the supraorbital region the central boss is extremely
well marked; also the brow ridges, which, however, are slightly
less conspicuous than the central boss. The ears are usually
large, flat, and simply-developed, with long lobes; but unfortunately,
owing to the heavy weight of their enormous earrings
this part of their ears is generally much deformed.
Sometimes I have seen children with a hole in their lobes
large enough for me to pass my finger through; with others,
where the skin was not so elastic, the lobes were torn right
through and the two sides hung down. In older people
one does not see this so much, as their long hair entirely
covers their ears. The average length of a man's ear is
two and three-quarter inches; of a woman's, two and a half
inches.</p>

<p>People have classified the Ainu as Mongolians, notwithstanding
that they possess no characteristics whatsoever of the
Mongolian races.</p>

<p>The colour of their skin is light reddish-brown, and not
yellow and sallow, like that of Mongolians; they are very
hairy, and the Mongolians are smooth-skinned; the features
of the one race are diametrically opposed to those of the
other; the mouth is strong and firm in the Ainu and weak in
the Mongolian; and the Ainu eyes, the strongest characteristic
of Mongolian races, do not slant upwards, nor are they long
and almond-shaped, as with the Chinese or the Japanese, but
with their long axes are in one horizontal plane, as in most
Europeans. Indeed, the Ainu have a much greater resemblance
to the northmen of Europe in their prehistoric stage than to
any modern races, and least of all to the Mongolians.</p>

<p>But let us examine the eye more carefully. The iris is
light brown, sometimes tending towards dark grey. One
seldom sees black or very dark brown eyes save in half-breeds;
and they are deeply set, as with Europeans. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
eyelids are no thicker than those of Caucasian races, though
they droop, as is common among people exposed to the full
glare of the sun. The broad ridges being very heavy and
prominent, cover part of the upper eyelid over the outer angle
of the opening. The eyelashes are extremely long, and the
eyebrows are shaggy and bushy. The eyes are full of animal-like
expression and emotional warmth, a thing very rare with
their neighbours the Japanese or Chinese. The long eyelashes
shading the large eyes and rendering them soft, together with
their pathetic and slow way of talking, make men and women
singularly interesting. Like most animals, the Ainu can
"speak" with their eyes.</p>

<p>The hair in Ainu adults is for the most part black, wavy,
and easily breaking into large curls. Among children, however,
one sees brown shades, which darken with years, until
the hair turns quite black. Along the north-east coast of
Yezo I came across several Ainu adults who had reddish hair
and beard; and in the Kurile Islands, at Shikotan, several of
the children had light auburn hair hanging in large loose curls
and rather flaxy in texture, while the hair of adults was even
darker than that of the Yezo Ainu.</p>

<p>The hair, which is coarse and strong, is uniformly and
thickly planted over the whole scalp, and reaches well down
over the forehead, where, as my readers will remember, a
space is cut out or shaved off. It grows long in men as in
women, but when it exceeds ten or twelve inches it is generally
trimmed in the shape of a half-circle at the back of the
head, and is cut off level with the shoulders at the sides. The
men have a luxuriant beard, whiskers, and moustache, which
grow to a great length. The hair of the beard often begins
directly under the eyes, and covers all the lower part of the
face. Many of the natives also have a few short coarse hairs
on the nose (especially noticeable in natives of the north-east
coast of Yezo). The beard, whiskers, and moustache begin
to grow in the Ainu when they are fairly young. A man at
about twenty can grow a good beard, and at thirty his beard
is very long. Ainu women, whom nature has not provided
with such a luxuriant growth of hair on the lower part of the
face, make up for it by having a long moustache tattooed on
the upper and lower lip, which in their idea makes them look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
"very manly" (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_245">Tattoos</a>). Baldness is not common among
thoroughbred Ainu, even at a very old age, when, however,
they generally turn grey and then white, which gives a patriarchal
appearance to the hairy people.</p>

<p>The Ainu face seldom undergoes the marked changes
common to civilised nations, as they are not subject to large
emotions; but different expressions are as easily discernible
by anyone who really knows and has studied the natives, as
the different expressions in the eyes of animals by one who is
familiar with them. When the Ainu is pleased he seldom
wrinkles his face and draws back his mouth at the corners, as
we do, but he shows it by a peculiar sparkle in the eyes and by
an almost imperceptible wrinkle in his eyelids, which contract
and diminish the opening. The corners of the mouth turn
slightly upwards. The smile is an accentuation of this expression,
with the additional lowering of the eyebrows,
especially in the middle near the nose, causing the forehead
to wrinkle.</p>

<p>Laughter Ainu know not. During my long stay among
them I never once saw a <i>real</i> Ainu laugh heartily, for the hero
of the dab of blue paint laughed less than he roared with
pleasure; and I do not remember even direct crosses doing so;
hence travellers have reported the Ainu to be "dull," "sad,"
"expressionless."</p>

<p>Certainly, the first thing that strikes one on coming in contact
with them is, how depressed they look, and how, even in
their work, their games, their festivals, sadness is greater than
joy. In fact, the Ainu, with their sentimental nature, enjoy
sadness.</p>

<p>Astonishment and surprise are expressed by a perplexed
look in the wide-opened eyes, by raising the eyebrows, and by
the contraction of the mouth. The hands are not raised nor
directed towards the object or person causing astonishment;
but if the arms be hanging down, the fingers are widely
separated. With the Ainu sorrowful emotions are more
marked than the more pleasing, the more joyous. Thus,
when in low spirits the head is bent forwards, the eyes are
staring and drooping, and the mouth is drawn downwards. In
greater grief howling is added to these signs. Ainu men
occasionally indulge in quiet tears without sobbing, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
women weep copiously at the death of their children when
these are young.</p>

<p>When an Ainu stands very erect, with one hand in the other
in front, and, turning his head on either shoulder, throws it
back and looks down at you with expressionless eyes, in the
meanwhile raising his eyebrows, you may be sure that he
means to show contempt. If, however, his eyes are restless
and his lips quiver, if the eyebrows are rapidly brought down
over the eyelids, while he opens his eyes wide showing the
whole of the iris; if the nostrils are inflated and he breathes
heavily; if the head is thrown forward and he is slowly arching,
and, as the French say, "making a round back," you may be
certain that he is in a very bad temper, and means to go for
you, if he sees his way to it.</p>

<p>When obstinate, the pose of the arms and legs is similar
to that by which he wishes to show contempt, but the expression
of the face is absolutely stolid, the eyes are firm
and frigid, meaning in that way to impress you with the
certainty that, come what may, he will not move from his
decision.</p>

<p>When actively angry, the Ainu sneer and snarl at one
another, frowning ferociously, and showing all their front teeth,
but specially uncovering their fangs or dog teeth; the arms
are stretched out, but always with the fist open&mdash;if no knife
or other weapon be held in the hand. Shame and disgust are
two expressions which one does not often see on Ainu faces.
The former I cannot describe, for I never saw an Ainu who
was ashamed of anything he had done; the latter is manifested
by an upward movement of the corners of the lips, and
a curling of the nose, with a sudden expiration almost like
a snort.</p>

<p>Shyness, which is the nearest approach to shame, is shown
by women when meeting a stranger, and gives them a submissive
look. They bend their heads and look down until the
first emotion has passed, when they gaze at the new-comer
with a certain restlessness and curiosity, again, as in so many
of their gestures and ways, reminding one of monkeys. I
never found any shyness whatever in Ainu men; neither could
I detect in them any signs of fear for objects, animals, or
powers with which they were familiar. Things which they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
not understand of course frighten them, like eclipses of the
sun or moon, or as my revolver did when I was attacked by
them at Horobets; and also when I appeared as a black-winged
rider on the north-east coast. In the latter case,
unfortunately, I was too far off to see their faces clearly, and
in the former, after the attack they showed more sensible submission
to the inevitable than true cowardice. What I chiefly
saw then was here and there a face with wide-open, undecided
eyes heavily frowning; while some of the others shrugged
their shoulders and closed their eyes, waiting for the loud
report of the revolver, which unpleasant noise, heard before
from Japanese guns, always gives a shock to their nerves.</p>

<p>When an Ainu wishes to show that something cannot be
done, or that he cannot prevent someone else from doing it,
he neither shrugs his shoulders like a Frenchman, nor shakes
his head laterally like an Englishman; nor does he throw out
his hands like a Neapolitan, but, quietly standing erect, and
with his head slightly bent forward, he gently lifts it up, and
slowly winking his eyes, says that he cannot do it.</p>

<p>When children are sulky or displeased they frown and protrude
their lips, making a nasal noise similar to this&mdash;"Ohim"&mdash;without
any of the vowels clearly pronounced.</p>

<p>Our way of nodding the head vertically in sign of affirmation
and shaking it laterally in negation is not known to the
thoroughbred race. Those, either Ainu or half-castes, who
practise it have learned it from the Japanese. The right hand
is generally used in negation, passing it from right to left and
back in front of the chest; and both hands are gracefully
brought up to the chest and prettily waved downwards&mdash;palms
upwards&mdash;in sign of affirmation. In other words, their affirmation
is a simpler form of their salute, just the same as with us
the nodding of the head is similarly used both ways.</p>

<p>It is quite enough to look at an Ainu's eyes to see at once
whether he consents or not, just as it is quite enough to look
at a monkey's face to know if it will accept the apple you offer
it. Slyness and jealousy are well marked in the Ainu face,
and the former is seen in the glittering, restless eyes, the
latter in the sulky glance and protruding mouth. Slyness is
a very common characteristic among Ainu men; jealousy is
recognised and frequent in women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
I could give a large number of other characteristic expressions,
of less ethnological importance, but in the present
work I shall limit myself to the principal ones which I have
attempted to describe, leaving out altogether "expressions"
of half-castes, so as to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>I must beg my reader's forgiveness for the "dryness" of the
imperfect description I have given of the Ainu physiognomy,
as many will agree with me that it is a great deal easier to
notice unfamiliar expressions on faces than to describe them
accurately in so many words.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="small">Movements and Attitudes.</span></h2>


<p>The Ainu people may be called physically strong, but yet
they are not to be compared to the Caucasian races. They are
fairly good walkers, capable mountaineers, and deft marksmen,
but they do not excel in any of these exercises, either by speed
and endurance in the former two, or by special accuracy and
long-range in the latter.</p>

<p>In the Ainu country most of the hard work is done by the
women, who thus surpass the men in both endurance and
muscular strength. Ainu men are indolent, save under excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
They will cover a long distance&mdash;say forty miles&mdash;in one
day, bear-hunting, and not suffer from great fatigue, while they
will not be able to walk half that distance under less exciting
conditions. The average distance which an Ainu can walk in
one day on a fairly level track does not exceed twenty-five
miles at the rate of two and a half miles an hour. The distance
he can run would not go beyond ten English miles, and this
is partly from want of training, as he never runs if he can help
it. If, however, the walk of twenty-five miles, or the run of
ten miles, had to be kept up for several days in succession at
the same pace, few Ainu could manage to hold out for more
than three days at most; while a walking average of fifteen
miles and a running average of six miles each day could be
kept up for a week. In walking and running women are as
good as men in one day's distances; but, contrary to what they
are in manual labour, they lack endurance in locomotion, and
break down after the second or third day. Men regard
running as unbecoming after childhood. "If we must go
quick, why not go on horseback?" says the practical Ainu,
who is as perfect a horseman as the Indian.</p>

<p>When riding, he is able to cover a distance of fifty-five miles
easily in one day on a good pony, and about seventy miles if
he changes his quadruped four times. Both men and women
ride in the same fashion, astride, and nearly always on bareback,
or with simply a bear-skin thrown over the horse. Pack-saddles
are only used when carrying wood, fish, sea-weed,
or other heavy articles; and though the Japanese of Yezo
designate these by the name of <i>Ainu kurah</i> (Ainu saddles),
they are only in reality rough imitations of their own pack-saddles.
Though women do ride on occasions, it is the men
who are the true equestrians. From their infancy they spend
a great deal of their time on horseback, while women ride only
when obliged. Being, therefore, accustomed from their earliest
days to ride pretty nearly from morning to night, men can
stand many days of hard riding, and are not so easily exhausted
as by walking or running. The Ainu are good at
horse-racing, as we have seen at the Piratori festival, but
foot-racing, even when the distance was short, gave but poor
results.</p>

<p>Weights and burdens are carried entirely by women, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
they carry them either on the head, if the load be not too
heavy, or on the back by means of a <i>Thiaske Tarra</i>, or simply
<i>Tarra</i>, a long ribbon-like band tied round the bundle, leaving
a loop which goes over the forehead, thus dividing the weight
between the shoulders and the forehead. When carrying a
weight with the <i>Tarra</i> the woman stoops, and the greater
the weight the lower the head has to be. The strain on the
forehead and muscles of the neck is greatly modified by
bending the body more or less; the weight increasing on the
shoulders in proportion as the pull decreases from the forehead.
The advantage of this contrivance is that it leaves both
hands free. Very heavy loads can be carried by average
women with this simple contrivance, and its common use may
account for the strong and well-developed necks noticeable
among them, but not among the men. Children are carried
on the back of other children by means of a modified <i>Tarra</i>
that has a stick about twenty inches long, the two ends of
<span class="figleft" style="width: 106px;">
<img src="images/illus-238.png" width="106" height="432" alt="THE THIASKE-TARRA, FOR CARRYING CHILDREN." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE THIASKE-TARRA,
FOR
CARRYING
CHILDREN.</span></span>
which are fastened to the two ends of the band.
The child carried sits comfortably on this stick
while the centre part of the <i>Tarra</i> rests on the
head of the child-carrier. This centre part is
generally lined with a piece of skin or cloth, and
ornamented with a few simple Ainu designs.
A weight which cannot be lifted with both
hands is easily borne for a long distance by
the aid of the <i>Tarra</i>; and I should think that
with it a strong woman could carry on her back
a load, say, of from eighty to ninety pounds. It
is difficult to institute comparative tests of
strength, as constant practice, without counting
"knack," often enables a person to perform feats which baffle
a much stronger man. Taken altogether, the Ainu strength is
relative to their height; but they are somewhat below the
average Caucasian races both in endurance, and yet more in
speed and muscular power.</p>

<p>When actively employed, the Ainu can abstain from food
for fourteen or sixteen hours; when quiescent for about twenty.
They can go without drink (when it is not alcoholic) for ten
or twelve hours without feeling inconvenience. A pebble is
often sucked, or a straw is chewed when fluid is not obtainable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
thus causing a flow of saliva, which to a certain extent quenches
their thirst. However, the reason given by the Ainu is not
this. According to them, certain stones and some kinds of
grass contain a great amount of water.</p>

<p>More interesting to me than their physical characteristics
were their movements and attitudes, which I was able to study
and note correctly without their observation. For instance
when Ainu try to move some heavy object they pull it towards
them. Thus, when they drag their "dug-outs" and canoes on
shore, and again when they launch them, they never push
from them, but always pull towards them. If an Ainu has to
break a stick planted in the ground he does it by pulling it;
whereas a Japanese will push it. Again, in pulling a rope the
Ainu pull; the Japanese push by placing the rope over one
shoulder and walking in the direction wanted. In a crowd
where a Japanese would push his way through by extending
his arms and thus separating people, the Ainu seizes a man on
each side, pulling one to the right and the other to the left till
space for him to pass is made.</p>

<p>As muscles are only strengthened by exercise, it is not
astonishing that we never find well-developed arms among the
hairy people, who so seldom make vigorous use of them.
Children are as fond of climbing trees as the average English
boy; and sometimes this is done in our way, by putting the
legs and arms round the trunk and gradually "swarming" up;
but with trees of a small diameter the ways of monkeys are
adopted. The arms are stretched, and one hand is placed on
each side of the tree. Both feet are then pushed against the
trunk, keeping the leg slightly bent, but stiff. One hand goes
rapidly over the other, one foot above the other, and so on;
and the more rapid the movement the easier the climb, if care
be taken to plant the feet firmly so as not to slip. Ainu boys
are dexterous at this; but I have never seen full-grown
men attempt it, though I am sure they could if they chose.
Elderly people are very sedate in Ainuland, and violent movements
are generally avoided.</p>

<p>Where the Ainu are indeed great is at making grimaces.
The Ainu resemble monkeys in many ways, but in this special
accomplishment they beat monkeys hollow. It would take
volumes to describe all the different grimaces which I saw them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
make, especially at myself while I was sketching them; but one
or two of their "favourites" may prove worth describing.</p>

<p>One Ainu at Shari, on the north-east coast, excelled in
moving his scalp, and by raising his eyebrows at the same
time creased the skin of his forehead to such an extent as to
make his eyebrows almost meet his hair. The nostrils were
expanded and the upper lip was raised so as to show the
teeth firmly closed. The same man was also good at moving
his ears. Others preferred to put out their tongue, emitting
at the same time a harsh sound from the throat.</p>

<p>Although many Ainu could not voluntarily move their scalp
they often did so unaware. When eating, especially if a piece
of food required some effort to swallow, the neck was outstretched,
the mouth closed tight, the eyebrows raised high,
and the scalp brought far forward over the forehead. In
masticating, the ears would sometimes move involuntarily, as
with dogs or monkeys.</p>

<p>The Ainu are also good at rapid "winking," first with one
eye, then the other, each eye playing at an inexpressibly
funny kind of bo-peep. <i>En revanche</i>, they make no great use
of their hands, and it is not uncommon for them to use their
feet to assist their hands. Indeed, their toes are supplementary
fingers, and they often hold things between the big toe
and the next, as when making nets or <i>Inaos</i> (wooden wands
with overhanging shavings). When making nets, the string is
firmly held by the big toe bent over; when shaping <i>Inaos</i>
the lower point of the wand is passed between the two toes,
which keep it fast while the long shavings are cut.</p>

<p>When women wind the thread made of the <i>Ulmus campestris</i>
fibre, they often let it run between the two larger toes
while they wind it on a spool or a reed. Then, again, the toes
are often used to pick up small objects out of the reach of the
hands, and also to scratch the lower extremities. The two
middle fingers of the hand and the three smaller toes of the
foot are seldom used by the Ainu, and are somewhat inert.
The little finger is slightly more active. Whenever Ainu
point at anything they habitually do so with the open hand,
for they have a certain difficulty in using any finger separately.
This difficulty is not so great with the first finger; but where
a European would use only his thumb and first finger, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Ainu uses all four fingers and his thumb as well, as in carrying
food to his mouth, picking up small objects, lifting a cup,
pulling his own hair, scratching his ears, &amp;c. That the Ainu
have more muscular power in the head than either in the
hands or feet when violent exertion is required is certain,
as I had frequent proof when requiring natives to make my
baggage fast with ropes to my pack-saddle. Where a
European would have done this by passing the ropes round
the baggage and pulling them fast to the saddle, the Ainu
set his foot (generally the right) against the baggage and
pulled the ropes with his teeth. By this method he used one-third
more force than he would had he done his work with his
hands. Though the Ainu are very supple about the body,
they are nevertheless stiffer than we are about the knees and
hands, which last peculiarity prevents them from learning any
kind of sleight-of-hand. They are supple because of the
singular flexibility of their spine and the "looseness" of their
arms about their shoulders. When resting or tired, the
shoulders droop so far forward as to prove that the muscular
tension which we constantly exert to have "square shoulders"
is foreign to the hairy people. The Ainu are deficient in
biceps, and such an arm as a blacksmith's or athlete's, which
is not uncommon among ourselves, is in Ainuland a thing
unknown. Their muscles have not the firmness of those of
civilised men. Want of use entails loss of power in the
muscular system, and that, unfortunately, produces further
results in paralysis, <i>kaki</i>, and rheumatism. In the legs the
<i>tendo Achillis</i>, which often assumes such enormous proportions
with us, is only moderately developed with them, though it
is generally larger than the biceps, owing to the habit of
walking and riding. Notwithstanding this, the centre of
muscular power, as we have seen, is undoubtedly in the
head, as with inferior animals; and the Ainu are fully aware
of this, for if not why should they carry all weights on the
head or by the help of the head? Why should they use
their teeth instead of their hands when an extra powerful pull
is required? And why should they <i>push</i> with their heads
when pulling with their teeth is not practicable?</p>

<p>Having examined the different movements of the Ainu, let
us now take some account of their attitudes. What struck me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
most was the unconscious ease with which they stood, sat, and
slept, no matter in what circumstances.</p>

<p>It may be well to repeat here that the Ainu are not
burdened, as we are, with articles of furniture and a code of
manners which so greatly modify our attitudes and make us
conscious of all we do. Moreover, we wear crippling boots
and nonsensical garments, which, besides not being ornamental,
more or less alter and deform different parts of our body, considerably
restrict certain attitudes, and greatly stiffen some of
our limbs; as, for example, the exaggerated smallness of waist
in women.</p>

<p>It is remarkable what a close resemblance the hairy people
bear to the prehistoric man as constructed by <i>savants</i> out of
skulls and skeletons&mdash;a resemblance found, I believe, in no
other race of savages.</p>

<p>Take an Ainu standing at ease; he carries his head straight,
but without stretching his neck, so that if a horizontal line
were passed through the <i>meatus auditorius</i> it would cut the
face directly under the eyes. If another line were drawn perpendicular
to the horizontal, we should find that the front of
the face is not on the same plane with the forehead, but projects
considerably beyond in its lower part. In thoroughbred
Ainu the head is well posed on the cervical vertebræ, and
seldom shows an inclination from back to front, from right
to left, or <i>vice versâ</i>; but in half-castes an inclination forward,
and also slightly from the left to the right, is a marked
characteristic.</p>

<p>The body when standing still is a trifle inclined forward, but
when walking the inclination is greatly increased.</p>

<p>The body is well balanced, and this inclination is partly due
to the head being abnormally large for the body; also to the
habit of keeping the knees slightly bent either when standing
still or when in motion.</p>

<p>The women, through carrying heavy weights on the head,
are straighter than men when standing as well as when
walking without a burden. Their spinal column describes a
gentle curve inwards, while with men it has a slight tendency
outwards. When an Ainu is standing at rest his arms hang
by his side, the palms of the hands are turned inwards with
a small inclination towards the front. But a pose which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
even more characteristic than this is when both hands are
placed in front, the fingers of the right hand overlapping those
of the left. When sitting this is their invariable attitude, but
in walking the arms hang by the side, and no swing is given
to them to help the motion. In running, the arms are bent,
and sometimes the hands are kept half opened about the level
of the shoulders.</p>

<p>The Ainu legs, notwithstanding their greater muscular
power than that of the arms, are neither stout nor well-developed&mdash;but
they are wiry. The hips are narrow, and the
legs are slightly curved.</p>

<p>The gait is energetic but not fast, each step being flat, with
the foot firmly planted on the ground. When in motion the
feet are perfectly straight, and move parallel to each other, and
at each step the heel and toes touch the ground at the same
time&mdash;an undeniable proof that the body is well balanced when
they walk.</p>

<p>The Ainu walk mostly unshod, and the average length of
the step in men is twenty-six inches (from heel of left to tip
of right foot), and in women about twenty inches. The
average number of steps to the minute is ninety-two in men
and ninety-eight in women. Where the Ainu is seen at his
best is when he is riding bareback. He sits so firmly that
animal and rider seem to be only one body. The knees are
slightly bent, and the legs and feet hang so that the toes are a
great deal lower than the heels, and are also turned in. No
voluntary muscular contraction is affected on the muscles of
the legs; for if the knees are bent this is because of the shape
of the horse's body, and if the rider "sticks" on his steed it is
merely by the counterbalance of the dead weight of his two
legs. The body of the rider is quite erect when riding gently,
but on increasing speed the body is thrown backwards, the legs
remaining in the same position. The single rein is held in the
right hand resting on the horse's mane, and the left arm
habitually hangs or rests on the rider's leg. When feeding in
his hut, the Ainu sits cross-legged, but in places where he can
lean against something, or out in the open, he squats, bearing
his weight on both feet, but with the legs bent to such an
extent that his head is on a level with his knees. Often his
arms are rested on the knees themselves, and food is passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
with the hands to the mouth, to be then torn by the teeth.
No forks, spoons, or chopsticks are used by the thoroughbred
Ainu; but Japanese influence has induced some of the more
civilised specimens of Volcano Bay and Piratori to give up
partly the use of mother Nature's forks and take to the <i>Hashi</i>
(chopsticks), also to adopt some ugly tin spoons as the sign of
their adherence to civilisation. Lastly, when asleep the Ainu
generally lie flat on the back. Sleeping on the right side and
resting the head on the bent elbow is also a common posture;
and when sleeping for a short period of time during the day
I have often seen men still sitting, bring up their legs, cross
their arms on their knees, and then rest the head on the arms;
thus placidly having a "nap" without waking up with a stiff
neck, stiff legs, and "pins and needles" in their arms, which
would be the sure result if the average European tried that
mode of repose.</p>

<p>Most Ainu have no bedding of any kind, and most of them
sleep on hard rough planks or on the ground itself. Some of
the people, however, sleep on bear-skins in winter, as it keeps
them warm, and the colder the night the closer all the members
of the family pack together to warm each other with their
natural heat. A strange peculiarity, when Ainu are asleep,
lying flat on their back, is, that instead of keeping both legs
fully stretched out, one, or sometimes both, are raised and
bent, with the sole of the foot planted on the ground. This
peculiarity is chiefly noticeable in men, and I have observed it
many times, especially in old people. The reason of it is this.
The Ainu having no pillow, the head has to be turned so far
back to rest on the ground itself that action at the other end of
the body is necessary to counterbalance the strain on the spine.
I came to this conclusion by being often placed in the same
circumstances as the hairy people themselves, when I found
that lying flat on my back on the hard unpillowed ground, if
the legs were straightened only a small portion of the spine
between the shoulders was supported, but by raising the legs
the whole spinal column rested on the level surface.</p>

<p>As we have now seen the Ainu asleep in a "comfortable
attitude," we shall leave them for the present, and I shall take
my readers to examine their clothes, their ornaments, and their
tattoos.</p>

<p>The Ainu men generally go naked in summer time, but in
some parts of Yezo civilisation has forced them to adopt cheap
Japanese clothes. It must not be supposed from this that the
real Ainu never wear any clothes at all, for indeed on grand
occasions they dress gaudily enough, but always in a rude,
elementary kind of way. For winter use they sew together
the skins of either bear or deer, fox or wolf,
making a kind of sleeveless jacket, which
protects the chest, the shoulders, and the
back. Another kind of fur garment of deer-skin
is longer and has sleeves, is large at the
shoulders, and very narrow at the wrist, as
a still further protection against the cold.
This deer-skin coat is mostly worn by women
as an under-garment. Besides these fur
garments for winter weather, they wear the
<i>atzis</i>, a long reddish-yellow wrapper, made of the woven
fibre of the <i>Ulmus campestris</i>. It has sleeves similar to the
deer-skin coat, only these sleeves are a great deal wider.</p>

On the southern coast some of the civilised tribes have either
adopted Japanese <i>kimonos</i> altogether, or make their <i>atzis</i> after
the same pattern, to ingratiate themselves with their masters,
on the principle of imitation being the sincerest flattery, and
perhaps also because they come cheaper in the end. The
<i>atzis</i> reaches below the knees, and is folded round the body.
It is kept in position by a girdle or belt of the same material, or
of bear or sea-lion skin. This <i>atzis</i> is ornamented
with embroidery both back and front,
round the sleeves, round the neck, and all
round the border, or, as we should say,
hem. The embroideries are done in Japanese
coloured cottons and threads. The colours
are invariably red, blue, and white, on a
background of this yellow <i>Ulmus campestris</i>
cloth. They have the same characteristic
patterns, and are identical with the ornaments
on knife-sheaths, drinking-bowls, moustache-lifters, &amp;c.,
as the readers will find in the chapter on the "Arts of the
Ainu." Men and women wear <i>atzis</i> of the same shape, only
those of the women are longer than those of the men, and
reach nearly to the feet. Moreover, the patterns which are
embroidered on the men's dresses are not considered suitable
for the women's, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Women&mdash;who, by the way,
do all these embroideries&mdash;have to content themselves with the
simplest patterns devisable&mdash;a mere thin line of blue stitches;
but they give to the men a more elaborate ornament. They
first sew on heavy bands of material, which then they embroider
in highly complicated patterns, thus giving a much heavier and
handsomer appearance to the male <i>atzis</i>. In winter the
sleeveless fur jacket is sewn over the <i>atzis</i>, and, as has been
said, women wear the deer-skin gown as an under-garment.
Ainu embroideries vary considerably, not only in different
tribes and different villages, but also in each family, according
to the talent and patience possessed by the embroidress. It
takes an affectionate wife a year or longer to ornament the
elm-bark dress of her beloved husband, and in the case of a
chief's robe the work never comes to an end, as additions
are constantly made. Children have an extremely simple
embroidery, when any, round the sleeves and hem of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<i>atzis</i>, but never any, simple or elaborate, either on the
back or front.</p>

<p>I have often seen women working patiently hour after hour
while sitting on the tiny door of their storehouses; and the
result of their labour would be half an inch of coarse stitching,
which for them was a great work of art. Most Ainu now
possess needles of Japanese manufacture, but in former days
they had only bone needles, and instead of fine well-dyed
Japanese thread were obliged to be content with the fibre of
the elm tree dyed black. The ornamentations on the <i>atzis</i> of
Ainu who have no Japanese needles are necessarily a great
deal coarser and simpler than those which are done with steel
needles and cotton threads. The essential characteristics are
the same in both. In sewing together skins for winter garments
fish-bone needles are often used up to this day.</p>

<p>These embroidered clothes, when new, are only worn on
grand occasions, as at a bear festival, or when paying a visit to
a neighbouring village. A few rags constitute the usual every-day
costume, and no difference is made between the in-door
and the out-of-door clothing. In fact, most Ainu sleep in their
clothes, such as they are.</p>

<p>One article of dress which is worn by all alike, young and
old, male or female, is the <i>hoshi</i>, or leggings. Like their
gowns, these are sometimes made of the
inner fibre of the elm-tree bark and sometimes
of rushes and reeds plaited as in the
ordinary rush matting. When of elm-tree
bark, they are often embroidered in the
upper part, as can be seen in the illustration.
They are fastened just under the knee
by means of the two upper strings, then
wrapped tightly round the leg and bound
round the ankle with the lower and longer
ribbon. The Ainu go barefooted in the
summer, but during the winter months, when
the cold is too severe for this, they cover their
feet with mocassins and long boots made of salmon-skin, and
often of deer-skin. When the Ainu goes for a long journey
or a hunt, during which he has to traverse rough ground, he
generally protects his skin boots&mdash;the soles of which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
soon be destroyed by the sharp stones and ice&mdash;by slipping
over them a pair of thick rope sandals, which protect the
sides, the back, the toes, and sole of the foot. If to this

inventory be added a head-gear
consisting of a band
wound round the head,
and an occasional apron,
the whole of the Ainu
wardrobe is catalogued. This band,
which is worn principally by women,
is untied and removed when saluting
or meeting a man, whether on the road or in the woods. A

<span class="caption">THE TARRA OR HEAD-BAND.</span></span>
Japanese towel often
takes the place of the
native manufacture. I
am inclined to think
that this custom of covering the head has been acquired
from the Japanese, as none of the Ainu of the Upper
Tokachi&mdash;the only pure ones remaining&mdash;wore anything in
the shape of band or kerchief, while it is extremely
common with the Ainu of Volcano Bay and Piratori to wear
these unbecoming towels. At Piratori the Ainu women
give a more artistic character to this ugly headgear by
embroidering it in front and wearing it like a tiara. An
apron is occasionally worn by Ainu, but this too, in my
opinion, has been borrowed from the Japanese. Ainu clothes
often get undone, owing to their shape, and therefore Ainu
men sometimes wear these aprons, but rather because they are
made to wear them than from native modesty or inclination to
be commonly decent. I have seen Ainu on the north-east
coast of Yezo and on Lake Kutcharo wear coarse hats of
matted rushes. When laid flat, these hats have a diameter of
about thirty inches; but when worn, they are folded in two,
and kept in this position by a string tied under the chin and
passed through the hat. They are used principally in winter as
a protection against the snow. The Ainu care more to adorn
than to clothe themselves. A few glass beads, a metal earring,
a silver coin, or anything that shines, can make a man or a
woman as happy as a king. Intoxicants come first of all
things, but after them there is nothing in this world that Ainu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
cherish more than personal ornaments, and this is, of course,
even truer of women than of men. What strikes a stranger
when looking at an Ainu for the first time is, as I have
already said, the size of their metal earrings and heavy glass
necklaces. As the Ainu cannot work in metals or make glass,
these ornaments have been purchased from Japanese, Chinese,
and Corean adventurers, and many costly skins of bears,
foxes, wolves, or seals are gaily bartered for a few beads,
worth next to nothing. The Ainu is fond of metals, but he
does not know the difference between one and the other. All
that glitters is gold for him; and if it is not gold then it must
be silver. Therefore some Ainu are known to have invested
all their fortune of valuable furs for a pair of brass earrings,
and, what is more, they have never grudged the bargain!
Previous to the importation of these worthless articles their
ornaments were made of wood, bone, and shells, of which
"survivals" are still to be seen with the Ainu of the Upper
Tokachi.</p>

<p>The large circular earrings are much prized: men and
women alike wear them. Many men, however, do not
wear these metal earrings, but prefer instead a long strip of
red or black cloth, or skin.</p>

<p>The lobes of the ears are frequently torn down by wearing
these heavy earrings from early childhood, and they know
not how to mend them by sewing them. Another hole is
sometimes bored in the upper and sound part.</p>

<p>Ainu women of civilised districts occasionally wear metal
finger-rings, but these are of course of foreign make, and
imported.</p>

<p>Ainu <i>menokos</i> (girls) seem to have no partiality for bracelets
or amulets, but necklaces are the dream of their life.
The delight of an Ainu woman in a new necklace is in proportion
to the size and number of the beads. A woman who possesses
one of extra large beads is envied by all her less fortunate
neighbours; and she who has several strings is at once
admired and hated by all the womankind of the village.
For, indeed, Ainu women are "human" enough to know
how to hate each other! The beads which most take their
fancy are the blue, black, white, or metal ones. The larger
beads in the necklace are in front; and the rough wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
pendants with bits of bone, metal, or broken beads inlaid in
it, which hang to the necklace, rest on the breast. Large
Japanese sword-hilts are often used as pendants by the Volcano
Bay natives.</p>

<p>The Ainu of the Upper Tokachi region had none of these
beads, but a rough wooden pendant was suspended round
their neck by a leather string.</p>

<p>Girdles are worn by men and women for two purposes&mdash;first,
to keep their clothes together; next, to support the large
knives which the Ainu always carry with them.</p>

<p>The Ishikari Ainu who lived formerly in Sakhalin wear
leather belts, and the women wear besides a peculiar cloth
headgear. Both these articles are ornamented with drops of
melted lead and Chinese cash sewn on to the cloth.</p>

<p>These are all the articles of clothing and ornament which
are in common use among the Ainu. None of them are worn
as symbols of rank, or to denote virginity. No Ainu can
explain why he or she wears one thing more than another,
except for the reason that he or she likes it. There are no
Ainu laws as regards clothing, and with the exception of the
"chief," who on special occasions dresses more gaudily, and
wears a crown made either of willow-tree shavings or dried
sea-weed, with a small carved-wood bear head in front, they
all dress pretty much alike. A chief could not be distinguished
from a commoner by his everyday clothing.</p>

<p>Speaking of personal ornamentation, I may as well describe
the way in which the hair is dressed, and also the
tattoo-marks.</p>

<p>Little care is taken of the long hair, which reaches down to
the shoulders. It is never washed, nor brushed, nor combed.
At the back it is cut in a semicircle round the neck. Over
the forehead the men shave a small part of the long hair,
which, falling over their eyes, is uncomfortable to them; but
women do not. Until lately this shaving was done with sharp
shells, and wives shaved their husbands. The process was said
to be rather painful, and the thoughtful women have now
adopted knives for that purpose, to the great delight of the
stronger sex. The part shaved is in the shape of a lozenge
two and a half inches by two inches respectively from angle to
angle. This open space causes the hair to part in two different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
directions and hang down in large wavy curls. The fingers
are occasionally passed through it, and then with the palms of
the hands it is plastered down on both sides.</p>

<p>A characteristic Ainu method of making the morning
"toilette" is to bend the head low and let the long hair fall
over the forehead. The two hands are then placed under it
on the temples, and suddenly and violently the head is shaken
and thrown back, the hair being pressed down by the hands at
the same time. If the first attempt at neatness is not approved
of, the process is repeated two or more times. I must confess
that personally I could seldom see any marked difference
between a head of hair "dressed" and one "not dressed";
but it must be remembered that the Ainu have no looking-glasses,
and what they think is right is of course right
for them.</p>

<p>Formerly, when an old woman lost her husband she had her
head entirely shaved, and when the hair had grown long again
she repeated the process as a proof of fidelity and affection to
her deceased spouse. It is very rarely done now. She used
to wear a sort of cap, with an aperture at the top, round the
crown of the head during the time that her hair was short;
and it was incumbent on the widow to wear a look of sorrow
and pain till her hair grew long again.</p>

<p>The Ainu men have long beards and moustaches, which are
never trimmed, with the exception of the Kurilsky Ainu, who
trim theirs. The beard begins to grow when they are very
young, but it is shaved till they reach manhood. It is then
left to grow naturally, and never touched again as long as they
live. Ainu women, whom nature has not favoured with such
a manly ornament, supplement their deficiency by having a
long moustache tattooed on their lips. Their hands and arms
are also tattooed.</p>

<p>The tattooing among the Ainu is limited to the fair sex,
and it is confined to the head and arms. Why and when the
fashion was adopted is not known, and the semi-Ainu legends
on the subject are very vague. One legend says that when
the Ainu conquered Yezo, which was then inhabited by a race
of dwarfs&mdash;"the Koro-pok-kuru"&mdash;some Koro-pok-kuru
women came to the Ainu camp to beg food from them, and
they did so by passing their arms through the reed walls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the Ainu huts. One day an Ainu clutched one of these arms
and pulled it in, when a tattooed pattern on the tiny arm was
greatly admired by the hairy conquerors, who adopted the
practice from that day.</p>

<p>A simpler reason is that the women, not being so hairy as
the men, are humiliated by their inferiority in that respect,
and try to make up for it by tattooing themselves. In support
of this theory may be quoted the fact that women are only
tattooed in parts which are left uncovered when clad in their
long <i>atzis</i> gowns.</p>

<p>The Ainu process of tattooing is a painful one. The tattoo
marks are usually done with the point of a knife; not with
tattooing needles, as by the Japanese. Many incisions are cut
nearly parallel to each other. These are then filled with cuttlefish-black.
Sometimes smoke-black mixed with the blood
from the incisions is used instead. On the lips the operation
is so painful that it has to be done by instalments. It is begun
with a small semicircle on the upper lip when the girl is only
two or three years of age, and a few incisions are added every
year till she is married, the moustache then reaching nearly
to the ears, where at its completion it ends in a point. Both
lips are surrounded by it; but not all women are thus
marked. Some have no more than a semicircular tattoo on
the upper lip; others have an additional semicircle under the
lower lip; and many get tired of the painful process when the
tattoo is hardly large enough to surround their lips. The
father of the girl is generally the operator, but occasionally it
is the mother who "decorates" the lips and arms of her female
offspring. Besides this tattooed moustache, a horizontal line
joins the eyebrows, and another line, parallel to it, runs across
the forehead. The tattoo could not be of a coarser kind. A
rough geometrical drawing adorns the arms and hands of
women, the pattern of one arm being often different from that
of the other. Frequently only one arm is tattooed. I never
saw tattoos that went further than the elbow, neither did I see
any other part of the body tattooed. The four specimens
given in the illustration show the patterns most usual in
different tribes, though each individual has some slight
variations.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 was copied by me from the arm of a woman at Frishikobets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
(Tokachi River); Figs. 2 and 3 are the two arms of
Kawata Tera, a girl of Tobuts (north-east coast of Yezo); and
Fig. 4 is the left arm of a girl at Piratori.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-253.png" width="600" height="446" alt="TATTOO MARKS" />
<span class="caption">TATTOO-MARKS ON WOMEN&#39;S ARMS.</span></div>

<p>It will be noticed that in the regions where the Ainu have
come in contact with Japanese, rings are tattooed round the
fingers, while the Tokachi Ainu women have none. In the
two arms of Kawata Tera (Figs. 2 and 3) the dissimilarity
of the two patterns is very marked at first sight, but on a
close examination it is easy to perceive that the operator
meant to carry out the same pattern on the right arm as on the
left; only through his incapacity to reproduce correctly his
former lines, or for other reasons, he got muddled up in the
design, and left his work unfinished. If all the lines in the
upper half of Fig. 3 were continued, the design would be
very similar to Fig. 2.</p>

<p>Tattooing is considered an ornament, besides, as I have
already mentioned, adding the coveted air of "virility" to
women. There is no religious feeling connected with it, and the
practice is rapidly dying out, as the Japanese men make fun of
the Ainu women, who after all only tattoo their mouths and arms,
while they themselves often tattoo the whole of the body. The
Ainu have no rules as to when the girls are to be operated on.
They are done both before and after marriage, contrary to
what has been said, that the women do not tattoo themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
after they have become wives. The moustache is generally
finished before a girl gets married, as she herself is anxious to
be thus decorated; but there are no rules as to virginity or
marriage, for the arms and hands are as often tattooed after
marriage as before. Indeed, in the Ainu country, "tattooing"
one's wife seems to be one of the pleasures of the honeymoon.
The design of these tattoos is meant to be, but is seldom,
symmetrical. The Ainu apparently execute these designs on
a preconceived plan, but the results rarely come up to expectation,
as no drawing of the design is prepared beforehand.
The bluish-black colour of the tattoo is very permanent and
strong, and many an Ainu woman is disfigured for life, who,
according to our ideas, would otherwise be good-looking.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="small">Ainu Music, Poetry, and Dancing.</span></h2>


<p>The music of each nation has certain characteristics of its own;
and though according to European ideas the music of what
are called barbarous peoples may sound in some sense excruciating,
it always has a certain occult charm, more especially to
one who is able to forget his former training, and teach himself
to see, hear, and think in the same way as the natives he is
studying.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly we Westerns have brought music to a pitch of
refinement that no savage nation has even attempted to reach;
but in my opinion we do savages injustice when we call their
music "unmitigated discord." Barbarians like the Ainu do
not indicate their rhythmical effects and modulations by means
of a musical notation; and harmony is of course very defective
with them, from our point of view. On the other hand, the
feeling and passion with which they chant their songs make
them go straight to the heart, if as a melody they are not
always pleasing to the cultivated Western ear.</p>

<p>An Ainu seldom sings for the mere pleasure of art as art,
and it is only when full of joy or "crazed with care" that he
gives expression to his feelings in music. Then he pours out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
his whole soul in that which to him is melody beyond the
power of words to compass.</p>

<p>After a hunt, a fishing expedition, a journey, or a misfortune,
the Ainu enters his hut and seats himself cross-legged on the
ground. He then holds out both hands with the palms
together, and rubs them backwards and forwards three or four
times; after this he raises them, palms upwards, to a level with
his head, gracefully lowers them to his knees, and then, raising
them again, strokes his hair and beard. Again he lowers his
hands twice, thrice, or even more times, according to the
amount of respect to which the person saluted is entitled, the
latter following in every smallest detail the motions of his
saluting friend. When this complicated salutation has been
performed separately before each male member of the household,
the new arrival relates the tale of his good-or ill-luck;
and if the events be of an unusual character the story is chanted
in a sort of sing-song which makes each note of joy or lamentation
vibrate in the heart of the listener. It is only in such
circumstances of stress of feeling that I ever heard the Ainu
sing, though sometimes women and young folks when alone,
fishing, riding, or travelling, sing out bits of their past lives as
they remember this scene or that event.</p>

<p>Ainu music is almost entirely vocal, and their singing has
more the character of the <i>recitative</i> than of the <i>aria</i> proper.
Their songs are always for <i>solo</i>; and during my stay among
the hairy people I never heard a concerted piece, nor even an
air or a single voice with a chorus for a number of voices;
neither did I hear any songs performed by men and women
together, but invariably by men to other men, and by women
to other women. It seems to me that the reason why they
have no choruses is their strict etiquette, which forbids them to
interrupt a speaker till he has finished his narrative; and as
their songs are only narratives which the musical sing-song
makes more impressive, it seems more than probable that the
reason I have given is the right one. If a singer during his
narrative stops, and is silent for a minute or two, another
takes up the "lost chord" in exactly the same intonation of
voice, asking a question or singing words of comfort, anger,
or scorn, as the case may be; but no Ainu ever joins in the
song before the person singing has stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
The hairy people are fond, not only of their own, but of all
music, and their ear is acute enough to hit a tone or note when
sung to them, and even to remember with more or less
accuracy a short air after they have heard it two or three
times. Many who have come in contact with the Japanese
have learned from them songs of a totally different character
from their own. Of my personal experience I can speak of a
boy who, while I was sketching, heard me sing a few bars of
the <i>Trovatore</i>. An hour or two later I heard him repeat
this passage, certainly with an Ainu <i>libretto</i>, and somewhat
Ainuized; but for all that he had managed to catch the
melody, which showed that the lad must have had some
musical instinct as well as a good musical memory.</p>

<p>The Ainu are remarkably quick at reproducing sounds
which are direct imitations of noises, cries of animals, &amp;c., and
it is instinctive in them, as when children they are not taught
or trained to do so. The education of Ainu children is indeed
a thing far to seek in every way, and what they know is self-taught.
Nature is their only school. The Ainu voice is
pleasant, flexible, and very soft in quality. The men are
mostly baritone and bass, the women alto; but when singing,
a falsetto is preferred to the natural voice, especially by the
women, and this always without an instrumental accompaniment.
Musical instruments are more than rare among the
Ainu; indeed, I saw only one, which is now in my own
possession. It is a black-stained wooden instrument, fifty-one
inches in length and three wide. The upper part is flat, the
under is half a cylinder scooped out by a knife, while five keys
are fixed in the short neck, in which a cavity is cut, leaving a
space for the strings to be tied to each key. The top is
circular, and flattened on each side. One very small hole is
bored exactly in the middle of the instrument and another is
at the lower end, where the point of a triangular piece of
leather, seven inches long, is passed through and fastened by
a knot tied in the leather on the opposite side. The five
strings, which are of <i>Ulmus campestris</i> fibre, are fastened to
this leather piece and then to each key. A peculiarity of this
instrument is, that it has two prism-shaped bridges, and they
are placed at each end of the harmonic case. The Ainu call
it <i>mukko</i>, which word, however, means only a musical instrument;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and as it is applied by them to all Japanese instruments
of music, it shows that they do not distinguish very sharply
one instrument from another. Though in my long journeying
I found one of these <i>mukkos</i>, I was
never able to discover any Ainu
who could play on it, and the Ainu
of Ishikari from whom I bought
it told me that the man, the only
one, who could play on it, was
dead. This was unfortunate, as
none of the others could tell me
how he tuned it; and one old man,
in attempting to solve the problem,
broke three strings. Seeing that
I was then quite unable to learn
any of the tunes of the deceased
Ainu Paganini I purchased the
instrument, and found by cross-examining
the natives that it was
played by twanging the strings
with the fingers, and not with a
plectrum, as is the case with the
Japanese <i>shamesen</i>. In the illustration
I have faithfully drawn a
front and a side view of this instrument,
so as to give the reader an
exact idea of its shape. The
Ainu of Volcano Bay sometimes
make bamboo jew's-harps for their
children; but even those are very uncommon, so we might
as well define Ainu music as entirely vocal. Ainu music is
sentimental, and not displeasing, but it is monotonous, and
continually repeats itself. It is difficult to establish a rule
as to what order of intervals their music is founded on, as
their progressions, modulations, and rhythmical effects are
often so peculiar as to make it impossible to indicate them
accurately by means of our musical notation; but the nearest
approach to it is the diatonic minor scale. The Ainu are
fond of chromatic intervals, and when their recital comes
to an exciting point they make use of this method in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
<i>crescendo</i> to give strength to the narrative, especially at the
end of the tune, which invariably winds up in the tonic. The
intervals which are of most frequent occurrence in the Ainu
tunes are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-259.png" width="400" height="71" alt="" /></div>

<p>The tunes seldom contain modulations from one key into
another, except in the case of genius-gifted improvisators, who
sometimes indulge in such a luxury, especially when intoxicated;
but the usual modulation is generally begun <i>pianissimo</i>
and in irregular time, and is sometimes like a slow lamentation
gradually and irregularly increasing in force, some notes
marked violently and the next very faintly, thus giving a
weird effect of light and shade. When a sentence comes to an
end, there is a chromatic interval <i>fortissimo</i>, and the keynote
generally concludes the tune. The melody repeats itself
again in the next sentence, sometimes altering the <i>pianissimo</i>
into <i>fortissimo</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>, according to the force which
the narrator wishes to give to certain words. The Ainu, as far
as I could judge, have no fixed rhythmical method, and each
man constructs his own. Their melodies are generally short
and simple, and the same phrases and passages&mdash;in fact, usually
the whole melody&mdash;occur again and again in their songs. No
Ainu melody that I heard was constructed according to any
rule of musical form. All were invariably of one part only, in
which the name of the tune was often applied to a certain
form of rude poetical composition. For instance, some of the
folk-lore legends&mdash;which, unfortunately, are not purely Ainu&mdash;are
chanted in a musical intonation, and are a kind of extempore
composition, though the roots of the songs and the verse
have probably been brought down from former generations.
This is proved by the preservation in them of some obsolete
words and forms of speech which are never used in current
conversation, and which none of the younger folks can understand
or explain. I believe, however, that none of these
legends are very old. The Ainu, having no written language,
it is but natural that their tradition and legends should have
been greatly changed and corrupted, especially by intercourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
with the more imaginative Japanese. It is to be noted, however,
that the Ainu, though to a certain extent as imitative as
monkeys, have also a large amount of personality and originality,
due to their shy and unsocial habits. This originality
is not surprising when we remember that they are taught
nothing, and that each man provides for himself and his family,
but has no markedly friendly feelings towards his neighbours;
in other words, it is a state of degradation very similar to that
of wild animals. Perfect indifference is shown by the people
of one village towards those of another. They are neither
friends nor foes. All have a right to live, but as for helping
one another, that is out of the question.</p>

<p>Having no written documents, each man, in his easy-going
manner, recites and sings as best pleases himself such verses
or legends as he has heard from his father or from some other
person, and the result is that, according to the reciter's greater
or smaller poetical and musical tastes, the grandfather's composition,
already altered by his father, is again altered by the
son, which makes it a composition of his own. This transformation
of a given theme is common even among civilised
nations when people are set to repeat the same story verbally
transmitted from one to the other&mdash;the version of the third
person has but little in common with that of the first. If this
we do with a spoken narrative, how much more with tunes
learned by ear only, and characterised in the delivery by
individual temperament and transient mood.</p>

<p>The Ainu do not teach these legends to their children, and
if learned at all they are merely "picked up" by ear and, in a
manner, at random; therefore, most Ainu profess ignorance as
to their existence, and a man, when I asked him if he knew
any, scornfully answered in these identical words, translated:&mdash;"The
Ainu are taught nothing, and they know nothing."</p>

<p>The few legends, &amp;c., that I heard were told me by Benry
at Piratori, and by another old man, the chief of a village up
the Saru River. The title of one was "Tushi-une-pan"&mdash;"Twice
Below;" the story of Yoshitsune, a Japanese hero, and
Samoro-kuru (a Japanese man-friend of Yoshitsune), who came
to Yezo and had a great struggle with a huge fish, which was
harpooned by them and disappeared twice under the water,
capsizing the boat which contained the two fishermen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Yoshitsune's temper was roused, and he cut the <i>nipesh</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
rope to which the harpoon was fastened. The fish went to
die at the mouth of the Saru River, when plains of hemp
sprouted out of its body.</p>

<p>Another legend, called "Kimta-na," is a rather different and
more simple version of Tushi-une-pan's story which I have
just related.</p>

<p>Yet another variant of the same legend is found in the
"Inu-sapk"&mdash;or "A Summer Story" (literally translated:
<i>Inu</i>, hear, relate; <i>sapk</i>, summer), which was so very confused
that I could not make head or tail of its minuter details; but,
like the "Kimta-na," it was about a famine in the Ainu land.</p>

<p>Then there was a fourth, which went by the name of "Abe-ten-rui"&mdash;"Burning
to embrace," or love-sick. It was again
about Yoshitsune, who had fallen in love with a pretty Ainu
maid, and could not eat either good or bad fish until she
appeared to him in a dream. As Yoshitsune was a strong-minded
man he got over his love, and taught the Ainu not to
be deceived by woman's wiles.</p>

<p>These and other similar legends, some of which do not bear
repeating, being too improper, can be collected at Piratori or
on Volcano Bay from the half-civilised Ainu; but I am inclined
to think that they are mostly concoctions of Japanese
ideas construed or misconstrued in the Ainu language.</p>

<p>Ainu do not indulge in poetic compositions which have a
definite metre, nor do they use special words for rhyme or
rhythm; but all the words in their songs are intelligible, and
seldom meaningless syllables are used, as in many of the
chants of other savage nations. This of course is because, as
has been said, their songs are merely a form of conversation
adopted on certain occasions.</p>

<p>Some of their music seems to have been suggested to them
by such animal sounds as the plaintive howling of bears, wolves,
and dogs.</p>

<p>Music is believed by the Ainu to have the power of curing
illness, or rather, of scaring away from the body those evil
spirits which are supposed to have taken possession of it; but,
when used as exorcism, the music is no longer grave, slow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and sentimental, but verily diabolical, consisting mainly of
wild howling with an accompaniment of stamping feet and the
rattling of sword and knife, and followed by a disgusting expectoration
of chewed convolvulus roots, which are said to be
powerful in expelling the evil spirit and restoring the sick
person to health.</p>

<p>Furthermore, music is invariably used by the Ainu&mdash;especially
by the women&mdash;to facilitate manual labour, as when
pounding millet, rowing, pulling canoes on shore, or drawing
water from a well, when packing sea-weed, or when preparing
salmon for the winter; and also in their games, which I have
already described in the chapter on the festival at Piratori.</p>

<p>During the process of pounding millet&mdash;which is only practised
in the southern part of Yezo&mdash;two or three girls stand
round a mortar in which the millet has been placed, and each
girl, holding with both hands a pestle, beats and sings, one
after the other, the words "<i>Huye, huye</i>," as the pestle is let
down, increasing in loudness when the grain requires harder
pounding, and slowly decreasing in volume towards the end.
This pounding begins about sunset, and the place chosen for
the operation is generally the small porch of the huts. It has
indeed a weird effect to hear these many voices from the
distant huts gradually dying away as darkness comes on, till
finally only two or three break the stillness of the coming
night. Then even those wear away, and everything becomes
as silent as the grave.</p>

<p>When riding on horseback, especially if alone, young men
are fond of singing, and when going through forests, chopping
and collecting firewood, Ainu invariably sing.</p>

<p>I have often heard two or three Ainu, when packing sea-weed
within a few yards of one another, each singing to himself,
and each so much absorbed in his own composition as not
to even hear his neighbours. An Ainu does not and cannot
sing unless he feels in the mood for it; but if he sings he is
carried away by his own music. Of course this is a good
quality in Ainu music, as in all arts where "feeling" is to be
appreciated as much as execution. The latter is to be got by
constant practice and teaching; but the first has to be born
in one.</p>

<p>My readers must forgive me if I am judging Ainu music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
not from the European, but from the native standpoint, for I
think it is only fair to give things as they are, without too
much reference to our own ideas.</p>

<p>With savage nations, music is the expression of the feelings
and passions of the musician. Thus, it is necessary to well
know the man himself before we can understand his productions
and appreciate them; and such knowledge is only
attained by constantly living with natives, not as a mere
stranger, but as one of them.</p>

<p>Very few travellers have seen the real Ainu, or studied them
accurately, while many, partly owing to their inability to
differentiate one race from another, have given us highly
imaginative descriptions, and even photographs, of Japanese
half-castes and actual Japanese, describing them as Ainu. If
such worthy ethnologists as have visited the "civilised part
only" of the Ainu country, have been unable to distinguish
types of the hairy Ainu race from those of the hairless
Japanese, or from mixtures of the two, undoubtedly racial
characteristics have been but imperfectly recorded.</p>

<p>It is more particularly in music and poetry, as I have
already explained, that temperamental characteristics are
shown, and one ought to be careful to clearly define what is
native music and poetry&mdash;in which I include legends, traditions,
and folk-lore&mdash;and what has been transmitted by neighbouring
and conquering races. Loud music is not appreciated
by the Ainu, and makes them grin with more scorn than
enjoyment. I could only try experiments in this direction by
singing to them, as I had no European musical instruments
with me; but I found that singing <i>con brio</i> at the top of my
voice was not so pleasing to them as when I sang <i>piano con
passione</i>. For instance, the song "Toreador," in the opera
<i>Carmen</i>, created fits of merriment from a crowd at Frishikobets,
while the same crowd, a few minutes later, listened
attentively and silently to Gounod's "Ave Maria," sung in a
kind of "miaoling" voice.</p>

<p>I may here mention incidentally, to show the different
musical tastes of Ainu and Japanese, that some months previous
to this I was at a concert at Tokio in which the same
"Ave Maria" was performed by some distinguished European
musicians. The large Japanese audience, who had been attentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and well-composed till then, went into fits of laughter
when Gounod's masterpiece was played, and all through it the
noise of people laughing was so great as to drown entirely the
orchestra and singers. Some of the women in the audience
nearly went into hysterics at the long <i>legato</i> notes at the
beginning of the piece. Louder melodies and of a livelier
character did not affect them so. I wish to draw attention
to this fact, that amongst all primitive peoples the native music
is sad and slow&mdash;the livelier melodies coming later; and also,
that with both wild and domestic animals the most noteworthy
effects are produced by slow and simple music. We all know
how dogs will remain quiet and calm when a soft and gentle air
is played, but get furious to the point of savageness under the
"plan-plan-rataplan" of a merry noisy tune. As for the last
item connected with Ainu music, viz., dancing, it is rarely
practised, even by the Ainu women, to whom alone it pertains.
At the best it is of a very rude form. In the Piratori festival
(<a href="#Page_30">Chapter IV.</a>) we have seen that their dancing is accompanied
by rhythmical sounds imitating the noises produced by implements
in everyday use, as the squeaking of a paddle by the
friction on the canoe, the cry which accompanies the pounding
of millet, blowing alight the fire, and similar sounds. Time is
kept by clapping the hands and by vociferations which tell the
partners what position or action to assume, each action being
accompanied by a different sound, but all performed while the
hopping is kept up. I have not felt justified in classifying
these rhythmical sounds, which accompany the dancing, as
choruses, for there is not enough in them to constitute either a
tune or a melody. They are suggested more by the action of
the arms and upper part of the body than by the steps; in fact,
if it were not for the continuous hopping it would be more
accurate to describe Ainu dancing as "posturing." The
dancers form a circle, with sometimes one or two children in the
centre. As there are no professional musicians, there are no
professional dancers; but though each man may be his own
composer of music, the women never alter their dances, which
are handed down unchanged from one generation to another.
It is only at festivals that the dance is performed, and never
inside the huts, but in the open air. It is not for the amusement
of spectators, for besides one or two of the older women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
spectators there are none; but it is for the enjoyment of the
dancers themselves. The men do not seem to take the
slightest interest in the dancing, and apparently regard it as
unmanly. They remain in the hut drinking while the girls
enjoy themselves in this way outside, and should one of them
by chance come out, he would stop and look on no more than
men in civilised countries would stop and watch little children
at play. On the other hand, on such occasions Ainu matrons
squat in a semicircle not far from the dancers, and keep up
a lament-like or sometimes quarrelsome conversation among
themselves, and occasionally encourage the girls in their
hopping, and suggesting <i>encores</i> of this figure or that, which,
between one quarrel and another, has taken their fancy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="small">Heredity&mdash;Crosses&mdash;Psychological Observations.</span></h2>


<p>The mental qualities of the Ainu are not many, and what
they have are by no means great; nor are they improved by
education, for what they know comes more from inheritance
than personal acquirement, though naturally every rule has its
exceptions. I repeatedly noticed that talent, such as it was,
ran in certain families, the members of which were all more
or less intelligent. Certain families were more musical than
others; other families were more artistic&mdash;if, indeed, such a
word could be applied to the very low development of the
artistic faculty when at its best among the hairy people.
Various members of one household were potently insane;
others were as potently idiotic. I shall not class under this
heading of heredity transmitted disease, like leprosy, consumption,
&amp;c., but I shall limit myself to heredity in physical
traits and mental qualities. Unfortunately, with the Ainu
intercourse between the sexes is so imperfectly regulated as
to often lead one to erroneous conclusions. The reader may
easily imagine the difficulty of establishing precise rules of
transmission in a race like the Ainu, where castes are not
marked, with the exception of the chieftainship in each village,
the only necessary qualifications for which are a sound, sharp
intellect, a strong physique, and personal courage. The office
is hereditary if these qualifications are also inherited; but
should the sons or brothers of the chief prove unworthy of his
place, the Ainu would assemble in a "village council" and elect
another strong, clear-headed, and brave man in place of the
<i>roi fainéant</i> thus summarily deposed. These chiefs have no
absolute authority, though the men often consult them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
their quarrels and difficulties, which they are asked to settle.
Thus, because of these qualities necessary for the office, these
chiefs are a slightly superior type to the other natives; for
with savages, as with civilised people, sharp-witted, strong, and
brave men are naturally of a finer type than those who are
their inferiors in these qualities: but the difference among the
best Ainu and the worst is so small that I do not feel justified
in classing chiefs as of a different caste. Besides, exceptional
beauty, strength, or larger stature is not necessarily transmitted
in the families of chiefs, nor do the Ainu themselves consider
them better-looking than others.</p>

<p>As Ainu laws of marriage have no relation to the physical
and moral improvement of the race, the only way of classifying
the natives for purposes of heredity is by tribes, each village
being considered as a tribe. Ainu villages are generally very
small, and the inhabitants of each village intermarry among
themselves, therefore each member of the community is in
some way related to every other member; hence heredity in
certain physical traits, mental qualities, and diseases shows
itself in one community and not in another. The difficulty of
tracing the exact connection of each individual with his or her
relations beyond the acknowledged father and mother also
baffles research in more minute details. Abnormal formations
are sometimes transmitted to many members of one tribe, as, for
instance, the hare-lip and webbed fingers, of which deformities
two or three specimens could be found in a small village
numbering fifteen or twenty houses. Malformation of the
umbilicus is common&mdash;sometimes in almost every member of
one small community&mdash;while it is very rare in others. Children
are mostly affected by this, as in some villages the cord is not
treated at all at birth; and this leads to an abnormality till
the child grows older, when the few who survive seem to get
all right. In other villages the cord is fastened in a very
primitive, not to say imperfect, manner, with a common string
of <i>Ulmus campestris</i> fibre.</p>

<p>Albinism is very uncommon among the Ainu. I do not
know of any case when it has been transmitted, as albinos
are greatly disregarded by the Ainu, and, I was told, seldom
marry.</p>

<p>Red hair, or hair with red shades in it, is common among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the Ainu of the north-east coast of Yezo, and also among the
Kurilsky Ainu of Shikotan, where nearly all the children have
light hair. It darkens considerably as they grow older, as
many of the men said they had light hair when young, which
turned dark with age. Members of certain communities have
inherited the love of bear-hunting; others the love of fishing;
some tribes have a musical aptitude, and a certain artistic
talent for rough ornamentations on wood; others have
developed their inherited power of sustaining hunger and
thirst. The only characteristic which all the different tribes
have inherited, without exception, is love for intoxicating
drinks; and this love is not only inherited by thoroughbred
Ainu, but also by half-castes.</p>

<p>Mixed marriages between Japanese and Ainu are frequent,
but the progeny are unfortunate beings, of whom a large percentage
die when very young: those who live are generally
malformed, ill-natured, and often idiotic. Their sight and
hearing are not so acute as with the pure Ainu, and crosses
are said to be sterile, with very few exceptions. If children of
second crosses are born they seldom live to be more than five
years old.</p>

<p>Half-breeds are invariably from a Japanese man with an
Ainu woman, but occasionally an Ainu man marries or
cohabits with a half-caste woman. I have never seen a pure-blood
Ainu man marry a pure-blood Japanese woman. The
majority of half-breeds are males: I should think two-thirds
males and one-third females. The half-caste women are
physically finer than the men, but they are said to be very
generally, if not uniformly, sterile.</p>

<p>The products of the first cross greatly resemble in general
look the Ainu parent, without being quite as hairy, though
still very hairy; but a strange peculiarity is, that they get
bald while quite young. One can easily detect them by their
eyes, which are frequently like those of the Japanese, by the
wide flat forehead, and by the pose of the head, which inclines
forward. They generally walk with their toes turned in,
instead of keeping their feet perfectly straight, like the pure
Ainu. The moral and intellectual position of these half-breeds
is a pitiful one. They are rejected by both the Ainu
and Japanese, and are held inferior to both alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
A high moral standard, whether got from philosophic
breadth or Christian virtues, does not suit a despised barbarian
race like the Ainu. Nothing could or does kill them
quicker than civilisation. Experiments have been tried to
civilise certain Ainu: they were made to wash, bathe, and
live in comfortable, clean quarters: they were instructed and
got good food; but after a few months they had to be sent
back to their native place and ways, for civilisation only killed
them.</p>

<p>The half-castes have none of the good qualities of either
race. They are neither as brave as the Ainu nor courteous
and light-hearted like the Japanese. The following remarks,
which I take direct from my diary, were written by me
between Shimokebo and Tomakomai, on the south-west coast
of Yezo, where many half-breeds are found along the sea-shore,
and I shall pass them on untouched to my readers.</p>

<p>"The Ainu along this coast were decidedly ugly. Many half-breeds
are also found along this coast. These half-breeds
invariably grow bald in early life, whereas the Ainu do not.
The hair on their back, arms, and legs is not so long or so
thick as with the pure Ainu. Their teeth are neither so strong
nor so sound. As is usually the case when a mixture of two
or more races takes place, the lower and upper jaws not being
of the right proportion, it follows as a matter of course that
unusual pressure and friction injure and wear out the enamel of
the teeth, thus causing premature decay. The Americans and
Australians are good examples of this premature decay caused
by the disproportion of the upper and lower jaws. Also, teeth
which do not fit well together sometimes grow so long as to
be a nuisance to the person who owns them. I found that
these half-breeds have all the bad qualities of both the Ainu
and the Japanese, and have not retained any of the good ones.
They are ill-tempered, lazy, and vindictive. It is well to
mention that, on the Japanese side, they have come mostly
from the criminals exported by the Japanese Government,
which fact partly explains why they are so evil-minded and
untrustworthy. Instead of falling into the more civilised ways
of the Japanese, these half-breeds prefer the wild life of their
Ainu ancestors; and if anything they are wilder than the Ainu
themselves. Insanity is very common among half-breeds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
The head is in most instances of an abnormal size; the frontal
bone is generally more sloping than with the thoroughbred
Ainu; and though the skull be wide from one temple to the
other, it is not spacious enough from the frontal bone to the
back of the head. They have heads so shaped that the animal
propensities are in excess of the moral and mental faculties.
In thoroughbred Ainu I found the bumps of amativeness,
philoprogenitiveness, and tune very well developed. In the
half-breeds these bumps hardly show at all, and in some cases
the back of the head&mdash;where the two first bumps are found&mdash;is
almost flat.</p>

<p>"Ainu half-breeds never live to be very old. They are often
affected with rheumatism&mdash;<i>kaki</i>, a disease peculiar to the Far
East&mdash;leprosy, and consumption, and they suffer from these
diseases much more than do the pure Ainu. I found leprosy
quite common among half-breeds&mdash;while I have seen but few
Ainu affected with it. In most instances, though, leprosy had
only attained its first stages&mdash;contraction of fingers and subsequent
dropping off of the three phalanges, ears, and nose; but
this may be explained by the fact that the sufferers in general
succumb before the disease attains its more serious character,
when the whole body is visibly affected by it."</p>

<p>Precise laws as to the degree of quickness of perception,
power of reasoning, and learning of the Ainu race cannot be
given, for, as I have mentioned before, almost each individual
would require a special rule for himself. My readers may
have noticed that, while some Ainu were but little above
monkeys, others were sharp, and gave answers very much to
the point. This may apparently be regarded as a contradiction
on my part by people who have neither lived with
savages, nor studied the temperament of beasts. But it is not
a contradiction. There are in this world clever monkeys and
stupid monkeys: some can never be made to learn any tricks;
others will learn them in no time. Intelligence is instinctive,
and not acquired, though of course it can be greatly developed
with education; thus, the Ainu are instinctively intelligent,
but I wish my readers clearly to understand that their intelligence
does not go much further than that of an intelligent
monkey, though of course the Ainu have the advantage
over beasts of being able to talk, and therefore, to a limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
extent, discuss and combine. The Ainu memory is a perfect
blank in certain respects, as with arithmetic, science, mechanics,
reading, writing, drawing, and delineating maps; while in other
directions it seems to be fairly keen, as in hunting, fishing,
tracking, and acquiring languages up to a certain point.
This last faculty is noticeable in nearly all the lowest
races, as the Australian aborigines, the Tasmanian natives
(now extinct), the Tierra del Fuegians, &amp;c. The Ainu ideas
of time are vague, and if you add to that the extreme
difficulty which they experience in counting even up to ten,
and their inability to count beyond that number, it is easy
to understand why we can never learn the exact age of Ainu
individuals.</p>

<p>Like the monkeys, the Ainu cannot concentrate their attention,
and they are easily wearied. Beads and shiny objects
have a fascination for them; but other objects, even perfectly
new to them, arouse but little curiosity, which soon passes, and
they show no intelligence and less imagination as to the probable
use of these strange objects. They show no inquisitiveness,
and no wish to be taught the use of anything new and
unfamiliar.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that at Yamakubiro, on the Tokachi
River, beyond the natural astonishment caused by the first
appearance of my ponies, the strange baggage, and myself, the
Ainu did not pay much attention to this novel sight, and did
not show any wish to have it explained, while more civilised
people, like the Japanese, would not have been satisfied until I
had shown and explained every article in my possession, and
allowed each person to try its use, &amp;c., after which they
would talk for hours of what they had seen. The Ainu are
not "built" so, and therefore they have never made any progress.
In the more civilised parts of Yezo we have a proof of
it. Their backwardness in acquiring the habits and customs
of their conquerors the Japanese, arises from incapacity more
than from conservatism. Yet for all that the Ainu are so incapable
of improving themselves, they are very persevering
in what they do attempt, as in their rough wooden carvings,
the hollowing of their "dug-outs," the construction of their
wooden tools and weapons, the weaving of their rough garments,
and the ornamentation thereof; but in all these they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
appear to act more automatically than with keen and constructive
intelligence.</p>

<p>The Ainu are not to be taken <i>au pied de la lettre</i>, for the
illusions produced by ignorance and untutored imagination
prevent anything like literal accuracy; but they are not what
we may call conscious and immoral liars. A good example
of this is my adventure at Horobets, when, although they
knew that they would be severely punished by the Japanese
policeman, the Ainu confessed their attack on me, and did not
attempt either denial or evasion. They are often plucky, and
even distinctly courageous; as, when out bear-hunting, a man
armed only with a large and not over sharp knife unhesitatingly
attacks this formidable beast, who sits up on his hind
quarters, sure to crush the life out of his assailant should he
miss his stroke. The Ainu, protecting his head with his left
arm, and having taken the precaution to cover his back with
skins, goes merrily for the embrace; and while Bruin squeezes,
the hairy man splits its body open with the large knife.</p>

<p>The Ainu are cool-blooded. They are not subject to strong
emotions, and therefore they are not much affected by dreams
and nightmares. They are not affectionate except for a
momentary impulse; but, like most animals, they are faithful
when they love. Mothers are fond of their children till they
have reached puberty; but after that the affection seems to
fade away. Paternal love is much less strong.</p>

<p>The pure Ainu are comparatively honest people, which may
be due to the incapacity for being dishonest. In a country
where there is no exact definition of property, where anybody
can get what he requires without resorting to theft, there is no
reason why everybody should not be honest. Then, according
to Ainu ideas, stealing is not always stealing. For instance,
if an Ainu, without asking, takes away some of the salmon
caught by one of his hairy brethren, he will be blamed for it,
he will get into a row, and probably be beaten; but if the
theft is perpetrated on a Japanese or a stranger he will be
praised, though the Ainu well knows that he is not acting
right. Their desire is stronger than their conscience, such as
it is; and having no laws of their own to rule them worth
speaking of, they often do according to their desire, without
deserving the accusation of conscious dishonesty. It is exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
the same case as when a dog jumps on the dining-table when
everybody is absent and carries off the leg of mutton which
he knows he ought not to touch; but the temptation was too
strong, and he could not resist it. The Ainu are fond of independence,
though in many instances I found them gentle, and
apparently submissive to a stronger will than their own. The
field of their brain-power is of course very narrow, and the
same rough, rude, primitive thoughts and ideas are constantly
repeated in their conversation as well as in their designs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="small">Physiological Observations&mdash;Pulse-beat and Respiration&mdash;Exposure&mdash;Odour
of the Ainu&mdash;The Five Senses.</span></h2>


<p>The following physiological remarks are mostly from observations
made on Ainu of the Upper Tokachi district, the natives
of which have had no communication with Europeans and
little with Japanese previous to my own visit to them. Observations
made on the semi-civilised Ainu of Volcano Bay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Piratori, on those of the north-east and west coasts, and the
Ishikari River, as well as on half-castes of different districts,
have been taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Owing to the lack of a clinical thermometer and other
instruments, I, unfortunately, was not able to ascertain the
normal temperature of the body; nor could I get any very
accurate observations as to the frequency of the pulse-beat,
owing to the miserable condition of my watch and the difficult
task of getting natives to sit perfectly still while their pulse
was felt. A superstitious fear, too, that some evil would
befall them accelerated the pulsations, and they invariably
moved away rubbing the spot I had touched on their wrist.
Though I could not count the exact number of pulsations to
a minute, the movement of the pulse was as a rule slow and
rather weak. Respirations were fourteen to seventeen to a
minute in men, and about sixteen to twenty in women, and
the respiratory movements were similar in both sexes, viz.,
costal breathing was predominant. In half-castes I have
sometimes noticed abdominal breathing.</p>

<p>The Ainu not only bear cold well, but prefer it to heat,
though, indeed, their country is never very hot. The sun's
rays have no fascination for them, as with so many other races;
and I have seldom seen Ainu basking in the sun for purely
physical pleasure, although they go about with uncovered
heads, and do not seem to suffer any ill effects from the practice.
The Ainu of Piratori wear Japanese hats of wicker-work;
and others, especially women, tie round their head a
Japanese towel&mdash;a fashion, as we have seen, also adopted
from the Japanese. With this head-dress the crown of the
head is left uncovered.</p>

<p>The Ainu are not massively formed, but they are sturdy,
and, as we have seen, can bear almost any amount of privation
as regards food and drink. Sleep is necessary to them, and
they require a great deal to be in anything like good condition.
The sleeping hours are generally from an hour or so
after sunset to sunrise; but during the day they are often
drowsy, and turn in to have a siesta after food and exercise.
In men the voice is soft and deep; shriller but still gentle in
women. The Ainu seldom perspire, partly because the pores
of their skin are blocked with dirt; partly because their long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
hair absorbs a great quantity of natural moisture; and mostly
because they do not drink much except when they can get
hold of intoxicants.</p>

<p>The skin is greasy&mdash;the natural result of many years of
an unwashed existence; and this gives to the hairy people a
peculiar and strong odour, much resembling that of monkeys.
Many are familiar with the peculiar odour of an uncleaned
monkey's cage, and the same, intensified a thousand times,
characterises an Ainu village. Hundreds of yards off you can
distinctly smell out a village, or if the wind is blowing towards
you, that peculiar odour is perceptible for a full half-mile.
Although the sense of smell is acute in the Ainu&mdash;for they
sometimes employ it in tracking animals&mdash;they are not aware
of their own strong odour; but they are quick in distinguishing
that of other races. I have several times heard Ainu of the
coast remark that I possessed a different odour from that of
the Japanese; but they could neither define it nor assimilate
it to that of any animal they knew, though several of them one
day held a lengthy pow-wow about it; and in the interest of
anthropology I submitted to the unpleasant process of being
smelt all over by them. The Chinese unanimously assert that
Europeans smell like sheep, and they say this is the reason we
constantly wash and bathe, being aware of our infirmity, and
doing our best to diminish it by soap and water. We ourselves
attribute to Jews one distinct odour, and yet another to
the Russians; not to speak of those belonging to the negroes,
the Chinese, and, in fact, all other nations. Thus, the odour
has some importance in the classification of peoples, as it
largely depends on the kind of food as well as the personal
habits of a race. Meat-eaters smell differently from fish-eaters,
and these again from vegetarians. As regards the
Ainu, their filthy habits of course increase their offensiveness,
while bodily exercise renders them intolerable. The Japanese
recognise the Ainu odour as a distinguishing mark of the race,
and Japanese fishermen have often said to me, "<i>Aino shto
taihen kusai</i>"; "<i>Saru</i>," or else "<i>Kumma onaji koto</i>"&mdash;"Ainu
men smell bad, just like a monkey or a bear."</p>

<p>As an Ainu grows older this peculiarity increases. The
weaker sex is generally more "strongly scented" than are the
men, owing to the fact that women wear skins and rough cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
rags nearly all the year round, while in summer the men go
about either entirely naked, or very lightly clad.</p>

<p>On the north-east coast of Yezo and in Shikotan (Kurile
Islands) I saw some Ainu who, contrary to the rule, had red
hair, and their animal odour was terribly offensive. The Ainu
do not use any unguents like palm-oil, cocoanut-oil, or the like,
by which the unpleasantness of certain African tribes and
Eastern peoples is to be accounted for. What they have is
natural and national, and due to their food, habits, and race
alone.</p>

<p>The Ainu have no partiality or dislike for any particular
scents, and their sense of smell shows itself mainly in their
power of tracking game or animals, as was said before. The
same might be said of the sense of "touch," which they seldom
apply practically, notwithstanding their sensitiveness in certain
parts of the body, especially under the arm-pits and on each
side of the spinal column and the back of the head&mdash;just those
parts which in most animals are the most sensitive; but they
have no developed sense of touch in their finger-tips, as with
civilised nations.</p>

<p>Most Ainu find it difficult to declare which is the heavier of
two not very unequal weights. Differences in the temperature
of two bodies, and in the smoothness or texture of two
surfaces, are also extremely difficult for them to define, while
it is easy for them to judge of weights and texture by eyesight.
The palms of the hands, which are so sensitive with
us, owing to the papillæ being more thickly studded there
than in other parts of the body, are less intelligently sensitive
with the Ainu. When they touch cold or hot objects they
feel pain, but not difference of temperature, as when with us
a wound is touched it makes little difference whether it is by
something hot or cold, it is simply pain, and not discrimination.
Their lips, as well as the tip of the tongue, are slightly more
sensitive; the lower lip more so than the upper. I was never
able to determine the relative sensibility of the sensitive parts
of the Ainu body, as my experiments either caused anger and
impatience, or hilarity and mockery. If the first, the observations
had to be stopped before they were well begun; if the
second, beyond the general results which I have quoted, the
answers were mere guesswork on their part, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
not worth recording. Most of my observations are based on
experiments made while the men were unaware that they
were observed at all. Often, when asleep, I have touched
them on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands
without causing them to awake, while when touched on the
lower lip or in the lumbar region they invariably woke up
startled. One day I tried this experiment on an Ainu who
was sleeping on his back, with his mouth wide open. I
touched his tongue with a well-sharpened lead-pencil, and
the effect was subitaneous; more so than on either the lips or
the lumbar region. The skin directly over the spine was dull,
but the ears showed a certain amount of sensibility. The
sense of "taste," which is a mere modification of the sense of
touch, is also dull, although naturally, when stimulated by
very acid or bitter substances, it produced distinct impressions.
Even with ourselves, though more perfected than the sense of
smell&mdash;which, however, often comes to its assistance&mdash;few can
boast of having the sense of taste very acute. In our lower
classes an extraordinary amount of salt, mustard, pepper, or
sugar is needed before they can call their food "tasty,"
whereas a person of more refined education will detect the
lack or excess of even the smallest portion. Over-stimulation
of the lingual nerves and extremes of heat or cold deaden
the sensibility of the tongue, palate, and fauces, and destroy
the power of distinguishing flavours; bad digestion also
frequently affects the organs of taste. From this we may
argue, then, that the sense of taste, though born in one, has
to be cultivated before it is brought to any degree of refinement.
The Ainu not only do not possess this acquired
refinement, but, through monotony of food, learn only one
kind of flavour, and cannot distinguish differences. Thus, as
many labourers in our country would not find any difference
between a beef-steak slightly underdone and one over-cooked,
so an Ainu finds no difference whatever between a piece of
salmon properly dried and one perfectly rotten. In this
respect the Ainu are far below beasts.</p>

<p>In tribes of natives like the Ainu, who have lived an
adventurous life, mostly in the open air, it is but natural that
the two senses of "sight" and "hearing" should be more
developed than those of "touch," "smell" and "taste;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
as life itself depends mostly on their accuracy and acuteness.
The Ainu possess good sight. Inflammation of the eyes is
very common among their children, owing to their filthy condition;
but it seldom affects their permanent sight; very few
Ainu suffer either from myopy or cataract, or other eye affections
such as are frequent among civilised and more studious
nations. In very warm climates, where the sun is powerful
and the light strong, the eyes are generally shielded by
specially long and thick eyelashes and eyebrows, which last
prevent the sweat from running down the forehead into the
orbit; but, strange to say, the Ainu, who are a northern race,
and have always lived in cold climates, have eyelashes even
longer and thicker than any race of people in tropical climates.
The iris is of a somewhat greyish tint, sometimes traversed
with brown shades. The white of the eye is less pearly than
with Caucasian races, and the eyes, shaded as they are by long
eyelashes and heavy eyelids, seem to possess all the qualities
necessary for abnormally long vision. And this we find to be
the case, for the Ainu can distinguish objects a long way off,
but they are dense as to minutiæ. In other words, the eye of
an Ainu is ready to receive an impression, but very slow in
transmitting to the brain the impression received.</p>

<p>As we have seen, they cannot reproduce the "human form
divine," or any faithful representation of anything animate or
inanimate which they have seen. They see <i>en gros</i>; thus,
should an Ainu's attention be drawn to some very distant
object rapidly moving on the shore, he will at once say that it
is a horse, because he knows that the chances are it is a horse,
but he will be unable to describe its colour, and whether cantering
or galloping, saddled or unsaddled, by a single glance at
the horse, unless his attention is called to each particular detail,
when he will answer each question correctly enough. The
Ainu vision is then strong, but the brain is not quick in response.
Testing their sight by "test dots," as used in the
British Army, was not a success, greatly owing to their inability
to count and the inaccuracy of their answers.</p>

<p>The most fully-developed sense in the hairy people is, in
my opinion, that of hearing. Distant sounds are clearly recognised
and specified, and they are also aware that by placing
one ear near the ground, far-off sounds of horse's hoofs and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
like can be clearly distinguished. The ticking of a Waterbury
watch could be heard by Ainu at a distance of twenty and
twenty-two feet, while I could only hear it nineteen feet away.
I was often struck by the quickness with which they detected
the tick-tack even when the watch was in my pocket, and they
were six or eight feet away. The unusual sound fixed their
attention and made them curious as to the cause, and they
showed a childish kind of surprise and delight when the
watch was produced and passed round among them, each one
being allowed to enjoy his share of the ticking.</p>

<p>Resuming these few remarks on the characteristic points of
Ainu senses, my readers will probably have noticed certain
facts which strongly support Darwin's theory of evolution, and
the hairy arboreal ancestor with pointed ears from which the
races of men are descended.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="small">The Ainu Superstitions&mdash;Morals&mdash;Laws and Punishments.</span></h2>


<p>I cannot begin this chapter better than by saying that Ainu
religious ideas are essentially chaotic. They recognise no
supreme God, and no intelligent Creator; and they cannot be
called polytheists, for indeed they are not <i>worshippers</i> of any
power&mdash;taking the word in its full meaning. The Ainu
worship nothing.</p>

<p>If they have any belief at all it is an imperfect kind of
Totemism, and the central point of that belief is their own
descent from the "bear." This does not include the smallest
reverence for their ancestor. They capture their "Totem"
and keep it in captivity; they speak to it and feed it; but no
prayers are offered to it. When the bear is fat, it is taken out
of the cage to be ill-treated and baited by all the men present.
It is tied to a stake and a pole is thrust into its mouth; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
when the poor beast has been sufficiently tortured, pricked
with pointed sticks, shot at with blunted arrows, bruised with
stones, maddened with rage and ill-usage, it is killed outright,
and, "ancestor" as it may be, it makes the chief dish and <i>raison
d'être</i> of a festival, where all the members of the tribe partake
of its flesh. The owner of the hut in which the feast takes place
then sticks the skull on to a forked pole, and sets it outside
with the others at the east end of his hut. The skin is made
into garments, or is spread on the ground to sleep on.</p>

<p>In addition to this rudimentary kind of Totemism&mdash;if I
may call it so&mdash;the Ainu show a certain amount of fear and
respect for anything which supports their life or can destroy it.
This, however, is under the form of an "instinct" rather than
a "religious feeling." Dumb animals of any kind are similarly
affected by powers which they cannot explain; but as we
would not think for a moment that when a dog is barking at
the moon the dog is worshipping the orb of night, or when it
basks in the sun that it is offering prayers and reverence to
the orb of day, no more should we think that the Ainu, who
are not much above dumb animals, worship all they respect
and fear.</p>

<p>If other writers, most of whom have never visited the Ainu
country, had not written on this subject, I would have limited
myself to saying that the Ainu, properly speaking, have no
religion, but as certain untenable theories and false ideas have
been published, I feel bound to state what I know on the
subject, that, so far as I can, I may correct these erroneous
impressions. I regard myself as qualified to speak with some
authority, as I am the <i>only</i> foreigner who has seen and studied
<i>all</i> the different tribes of Ainu in Yezo and the Kuriles; while
other writers, the few who have actually been there, have
based their statements on a few half-castes or Ainu in the
more civilised part of southern Yezo, collecting from them
ideas left behind by previous travellers, and offering them
to the public as purely Ainu. That these hasty travellers and
cursory writers have been deceived, or have deceived themselves,
is not astonishing; for it must be borne in mind that
the Ainu language is as poor in words as the Ainu brain is
deficient in thoughts. Thus it is no easy matter to explain to
an Ainu what is meant by "religion," by "divinities," and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
"worship." The nearest approach can be made only by
comparisons and analogies, which often lead far from the
point aimed at. Like all savages and barbarians, the Ainu
are more apt to answer as they think will please the questioner
than to give a definition of their own beliefs. The manner in
which a question is put gives the keynote to the reply, which
is in no sense an independent statement of their own thoughts.</p>

<p>For instance, if you were to say to an Ainu, "You are old,
are you not?" he would answer "Yes"; but if you asked the
same man, "You are not old, are you?" he would equally
answer "Yes." Knowingly speaking the truth is not one of
their characteristics; indeed, they do not know the difference
between falsehood and truth. This is a common failing with
all savages as well as with all Orientals; but with the Ainu it
is even more accentuated; and when, in addition to this, the
difficulty of making them understand exactly what one
means is taken into consideration, it is not astonishing that a
traveller arrives at a wrong conclusion if the utmost pains be
not taken in pursuing one's investigations.</p>

<p>Of course the Ainu who have come in contact with
Japanese know of a God, and some of them, at the instigation
of Japanese <i>bonzes</i>, have become nominal Buddhists.
Benry, at Piratori, showed me a small Buddhist shrine, of
Japanese manufacture, which had been put up on a neighbouring
hill. All the time I stayed at Piratori I never observed
any Ainu worship at it. One day I saw two boys throwing
stones at it, but that could hardly be called an act of reverence,
even among my hairy friends.</p>

<p>On my inquiring as to the origin and use of the shrine, I
was told by some that it was erected to the God of the
Japanese. Benry, who was always "well informed," both in
things that he knew and those that he did not know, said that
it was built in honour of Yoshitsune, the Japanese personage
who, as we have seen, is the hero in semi-Ainu legends, and
whose image or spirit, according to travellers' tales, is worshipped
by the Ainu.</p>

<p>It always appeared strange to me that the Piratori Ainu
had this Japanese hero in their legends, but still more strange
that they should make him their deity. Yet what was most
singular of all was, that with the exception of Benry and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
others at Piratori, no other Ainu I met in any other part of
Yezo seemed to know about Yoshitsune&mdash;or Okikurumi, as
he is sometimes called by them; and, moreover, they knew
nothing of his doings, or of the reason of his being worshipped.
The Ainu of the Tokachi knew nothing whatever of this personage.</p>

<p>The Ainu idea of soul is always associated with "breath" or
"life;" and as for the resurrection of the body and the future
life of the soul, they have never even dreamt of it. Metempsychosis
is equally unknown to them.</p>

<p>As my readers have seen, in the description of a burial the
implements and weapons which belonged to a deceased person
are buried with him. The articles, however, previous to being
thrown into the grave, are smashed to pieces; for the idea is,
not that the dead body should profit by these things in the
other world, but that no other person should make use of what
had been his property in this. The reasoning power of the
Ainu does not carry him beyond what is purely material; his
mind has never been trained to go beyond that limit, and he
finds that he can live well within it. Like all animals, he is
guided by his instinct, which tells him what is good and what
is bad for him; but as to any attempt to find out <i>why</i> such
things are good or bad for him, he is utterly at a loss, and has
to give up the quest. Though not devoid of a rudimentary
kind of shrewdness, the Ainu is dense and ignorant to the last
degree, and just as he is reluctant to adopt new modes of
living, so he is unable to accept new ideas or larger thoughts.
The mere conception of a Superior Being, who is the Maker
of all things and above all things, is far beyond the comprehension
of any Ainu. Eating and drinking are what he principally
lives for. He does not thirst for knowledge, nor strive
after the Divine; and he has no creed of any kind and no
formula of sacrifice or worship, which two conditions are essential
to even the most elementary religion.</p>

<p>What the Ainu do really possess in the way of supernaturalism
is the ordinary savage's credulous superstition, which
manifests itself in certain charms or fear of certain omens. However,
after that degree they take the world as it comes. They
have no idea of who made it, and they are not anxious to learn.
The sun, the moon, bears, salmon, water, fire, mountains, trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
are all things for which an Ainu has a dumb kind of regard,
not amounting to reverence, as he knows that he could not
live without them. This has led some persons to define these
objects as the principal divinities of the Ainu, and to call the
people themselves polytheists. The word <i>Kamoi</i>, or <i>Kamui</i>,
has been rendered as "god," gods "divinity." Now, what does
the word <i>Kamoi</i>, or <i>Kamui</i>, really mean? Translated literally
it means "old" or "ancient"; but amongst a hundred other
meanings it also denotes "large," "beautiful," "strange," "it,"
"the man," "he who," &amp;c. In fact, it is used to qualify anything,
whether good or bad; and in some ways corresponds to
our adjectives "wonderful," "awful," "grand "; but assuredly the
Ainu do not by this word mean to designate the objects thus
described as so many gods. Anything for which they entertain
respect or fear is described as <i>Kamoi</i>, or <i>Kamui</i>, which thus is
applied to the sun, the moon, the stars, mountains, rivers, old
trees, bears, salmon, large stones, &amp;c., not with the intention
of making them divinities, but simply to specify their power,
greatness, or antiquity. The word is applied to every kind of
thing, animate or inanimate, good or bad, respected or derided,
dreaded or revered, admired or abhorred. It is sometimes a
prefix, sometimes an affix, and is the most universal attribute
the Ainu world or language contains. We are, therefore,
forced to the conclusion, that either the Ainu are polytheists
or pantheists to such an extent as occasionally to make everything
and everybody a god; or else, that translators have given
their own, and a greatly exaggerated, meaning to the word
<i>Kamui</i>, and that these so-called gods are not gods at all. To
me there is no alternative opinion on the matter. The Ainu
have no gods in our sense.</p>

<p>Basing conclusions on wrong premises, writers on the Ainu
religion have been naturally led astray altogether. For instance,
the composite word <i>Kotan-kara-kamui</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> which a learned
missionary has translated "Creator," only means "the man
who made the village"&mdash;a description which hardly corresponds
to the grandeur attributed to the words by its imaginative
translator.</p>

<p>Then again, <i>Kamui kotan</i>, which according to some means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
"the home of God," in its real signification is "an ancient
village; a beautiful place." When <i>Kamui</i> is applied to persons,
it is generally a suffix; when to things, it is a prefix.</p>

<p>But let us come to the <i>inao</i>, which by some have been
called the "Ainu gods," by others "Divine symbols." These
<i>inao</i> are willow-wands, with shavings depending from the
upper end, sometimes from the middle, and occasionally from
near the lower end as well.</p>

<p>The larger wands are about four feet in length, and have
either one or two bunches of shavings at the upper end only.
They go by the name of <i>inao netuba</i>, or "big <i>inao</i>." Other
smaller <i>inao</i>, like the <i>Chisei-kara-inao</i>,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> are kept in the house,
and stuck in the eastern corner of the hearth, and in the wall
directly opposite the entrance door. Some of the <i>inao</i> are
shaved upwards from the bottom, others downwards from the
top; and one, a big <i>inao</i>, is often thrust through the small
window facing the east. Sometimes they are placed about
singly, especially inside the huts; but outside, close to the
eastern wall, I have often seen eight or ten standing together
in a row. When so taken collectively they are called <i>nuza</i>.
On Volcano Bay, up the Saru River, and on the Lake Kutcharo,
where it is the custom of the Ainu to make trophies of
the skulls of bears and deer which have been killed in the
hunt, one or two <i>inao</i> are placed at the foot of the trophy.
Sometimes, but very rarely, a whole <i>nuza</i> is to be seen in
front of a trophy; but in most cases the <i>nuza</i> I saw were
near huts that had no trophy at all, and, as I say, only very
seldom were they in front of the trophy itself, unless a bear
feast was going on. I am therefore under the impression that
these <i>nuza</i> are only put up when some festival takes place,
and that they are not kept there permanently. I remember
that at Piratori there were no <i>inao</i> and no <i>nuza</i> outside
Benry's house, but on the day that the festival took place one
was put up, and several <i>inao</i> were placed inside the hut, in the
hearth and on the north wall. Likewise, a <i>nuza</i> was put up
on the same day at the east end of the hut in which the feast
was given, and the inside was also adorned with <i>inao</i> of various
sizes and descriptions. Each <i>inao</i> is pointed at the lower end,
so as to be easily stuck in the ground. The <i>inao</i> of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
sizes and shapes impressed me as being mostly for ornament.
Then some are held as charms against misfortune and
disease; but they never impressed me as being offerings to
the gods. <i>Inao</i> are placed near springs, so that the good
water may not turn into pestilential, and occasionally <i>inao</i>
of a peculiar shape are hung in the doorway of newly-built
huts. They are made of a number of small willow sticks tied
together, from which hang five or six bunches of shavings;
they are hung horizontally, and not in a vertical position, like
the other <i>inao</i>. They are very uncommon, and only used on
certain specified occasions. For example, when a child is born
an <i>inao</i>, in the shape of a doll, is made of a bunch of reeds
folded double and tied with a string about an inch from the
bend, which thus forms the head; it is then tied lower down
to indicate the waist. By dividing the reeds into two equal
portions they produce a pair of legs, and a stick is then passed
through the reeds between the head and the waist to form the
arms. When this doll is made it is placed near the infant, so
that should any disease or misfortune, in the shape of a kind
of evil spirit, be tempted to enter the child's body, it may be
averted, and enter the doll instead. Should a person fall ill new
<i>inao</i> are stuck in the hearth, as the Ainu share our own idea
that evil spirits dwell mostly in fire; others are placed near the
sick person. They are not meant as offerings to the gods for
his or her quick recovery, but merely to bring good luck to the
individual whose body they think has been taken possession
of by "animals inside," or, in other words, evil spirits.</p>

<p>Even at the present day in England and on the Continent
horseshoes for luck are hung over entrance doors, and if a
horseshoe be fastened on to a stable-door, the beasts within
are supposed to be held free from accidents and illness.</p>

<p>In Spain and Italy little red rags tied to a small wand, not
dissimilar in shape to a small Ainu <i>inao</i>, are stuck in flower-pots
near windows, over beds, doors, and up chimneys, to
keep witches at bay, red being a powerful exorcist in the way
of colours, and as good as the "running stream which witches
dare not cross." Some hysterical women have declared that
they have seen witches hiding in the smoke of the boiling
<i>Pentola</i> (the earthenware pot in which the soup is boiled)&mdash;but
that on seeing the red rags they vanished, and never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
visited the house again. Italian and Spanish women and
children almost invariably carry charms round their necks,
that are to keep them safe from harm; and, furthermore,
when a child falls ill, one or more red rags are fastened to its
bed before a doctor is sent for. Then, again, people suffering
from epileptic fits have often been supposed to be "possessed,"
and beaten to death or burnt alive, so that the evil spirit which
was in them should thus be destroyed. It must be borne in
mind that not many centuries ago similar beliefs were prevalent
even in free and enlightened England.</p>

<p>If we compare these beliefs with those of the Ainu, we find
that they differ very little either in form or substance. In
place of the witches which our own ancestors, modern Italians,
and Spaniards, and some benighted peasantry still to be found
in the West of England, believed, and do still believe in, the
Ainu have imaginary animals or evil spirits. The wands and
red rags of our Latin neighbours are represented by their
<i>inao</i>; and our lucky horseshoe is with them the horizontal
<i>inao</i>. Charms are worn by the Ainu men, women, and
children; and when going to war or to hunt the men carry
a block of wood to which their knife or sword is attached, and
on the right-hand side of which hangs a small <i>inao</i>.</p>

<p>These blocks of wood are flattened, and are elliptical at
both ends. Their length varies from four to fifteen inches,
and sometimes ornaments&mdash;generally circles&mdash;are carved on
them. A string is fastened on one side so as to sling them
to the shoulder; but they are usually carried under the arm.
They are supposed to protect the carrier from accidents, and
also to bring him good fortune.</p>

<p>We see, then, that similar ideas are entertained by utterly
different peoples thousands of miles distant from one another;
and that certain superstitious beliefs left on this side of the
globe find their parallel among the hairy people on the other.
Of course with them it is natural that their beliefs should
count for more than with Europeans, as civilisation has not in
any way enlarged or improved their minds; but it seems to
me unfair that the same identical beliefs should go under the
name of <i>superstitions</i> when applied to Europeans, and called
the "Ainu religion" when practised by the hairy inhabitants
of Northern Japan. Though to this I know it may be replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
that, as all things spring from germs, so these ignorant superstitions
of the Ainu may be in a manner called their religion,
as the germ of a more developed system&mdash;the cotyledonous
state of what might grow into a more advanced spirituality.
Like the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Ainu wave their
moustache-lifters, during their libations, towards the sun, the
fire, and the person who has paid for the wine, before they
address themselves to the large wooden bowls wherein lies
their happiness; but this also is not a religious ceremony, and
no religious feeling whatever is connected with it. It is a
mere <i>toast</i>&mdash;part of their etiquette&mdash;which exactly corresponds
to the German "<i>Prosit</i>," or to our English "Your good
health." The Ainu of course have no special high-days, no
Sundays, no religious services, no prayers, no priests, no sacrificial
priests, no churches, and no bells; but they can "swear";
and as the Neapolitans invoke their saints, so they occasionally
call the sun, the moon, the fire, and everything else, all
sorts of bad names if things do not go as they ought. This
"swearing" has been defined as <i>Ainu praying</i> by one authority
on the Ainu religion; moreover, the same authority calls the
Ainu a "distinctly religious people," and an "exceedingly
religious race!" To anyone who visits a country and regards
all that he finds from one point of view only, it is not difficult
to interpret words and things in accordance with the preconceived
idea; but however high the principles sought to be
established, I do not consider a man justified in attributing to
definite facts an importance and significance to which they have
no claim. I have no doubt that a native who had associated
with or been in the employment of a Christian would make
statements in accordance with his master's belief as it had been
taught him; but it is incorrect to offer these "borrowed statements"
as the religious beliefs of a whole nation.</p>

<p>I shall not discuss this question at greater length; but for
the sake of readers who are interested in the subject it may
be well to make two or three more statements before closing this
chapter. The Ainu do not know of a heaven and hell; but
in one of the latest publications on the aborigines of Japan
we are told that they do; and, moreover, that they are fully
aware of the resurrection of the body in the other world!</p>

<p>Even assuming, for the moment, that the Ainu are theists, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
polytheists, after what we have heard of their gods, this is a
somewhat surprising statement. It will be remembered that
anything good or bad, dreaded or repulsive, respected or not respected,
is qualified by the Ainu as <i>Kamui</i>, and we shall attribute
for a while the imaginary meaning of "God" to the word. Now,
if everything and everybody, good or bad, is equally a god, I
myself fail to see the necessity of a hell, as the chances are that
all the gods would inhabit heaven. This alone serves to show
how absurd the theory is; but I wish to give the exact translation
of the words <i>Kando</i> and <i>Teine-pokna-moshiri</i>, which are
said to be the two Ainu expressions for "heaven" and "hell."</p>

<p><i>Kando</i> means "sky," not "heaven." <i>Teine-pokna-moshiri</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
stands for the "wet earth under(ground)." As the Ainu are in
the habit of burying their dead, I find it more rational to apply
to the words in question the meaning of a "burial-place," a
"cold place of rest" rather than that of Hades or Gehenna.</p>

<p>"They" (the Ainu), says a learned missionary, "seem to conceive
of men and women as living in large communities in the
other world in the same way and under the same conditions
as they do in this, excepting that they can know no death."
In other words, resurrection of the body and eternal life.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the writer of the same lines asserted in
the "Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan,"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> that
"The Ainu <i>know nothing</i> of a resurrection of the body."</p>

<p>It must not be argued that because they have no religion
the Ainu are bad people. They are far from it. They are
decidedly not moral, for nothing is immoral among them.
The Ainu must be considered more as animals than as human
beings. When we speak of a dog, we do not ask whether it is a
moral dog, but only if it is a good dog. The same can be said
of the Ainu. We cannot compare them to ourselves, nor judge
them by our own standard of morality. Taken by themselves
they are gentle, kind, brave, and above everything they are
simple. Their language, manners, customs, arts, habits, as we
have seen, are the very simplest and rudest possible. Thus, it
is absurd to suppose that such simple brains could entertain
high religious ideas. If they had brains enough to compass
high religious beliefs they would long ago have used those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
brains in bettering their miserable condition and filthy mode of
living. They would have striven to make the beginnings of a
history and a literature, or at least to have devised or adopted
some mode of writing with which they could preserve these
high ideas, and pass them on from generation to generation.
Even their language is so poor in words as to hardly express
their everyday wants. The Ainu are low in the scale of
humanity. They have always been low; they have not sunk,
for they have never risen. They have never done any harm
in this world, and they will never do any good.</p>

<p>The Ainu are without laws, which, paradoxical as it sounds,
to a great extent makes them good. People are never so good
as when no harm can be done. There are indeed few crimes
among them; no voluntary infanticides; very very rarely
murders; no suicides; little theft, and as little treachery among
people of the same tribe. Though usually retiring and reserved,
they are hospitable on special occasions, and generous
with what little they possess. The young show an instinctive
reverence for the aged, without considering it a virtue or a duty.
Cowardice is despised by the Ainu, but courage, endurance of
pain, and hardship, drunkenness, and similar qualities, are looked
on as the chief virtues in men. Punishments are seldom inflicted
by Ainu on any of their tribesmen, and the crime must indeed
be great to raise the whole community against the criminal. If
by rare chance some great evil has been done, the chief of the
village and all the men assemble, and decide on the punishment
to be inflicted. Flogging is the general punishment for
the lesser crimes, which, according to Ainu ideas, are theft and
assault. The murder of a tribesman is sometimes punished
by cutting the tendons of the hands and feet of the murderer,
thus disabling him from hunting or fishing. If, however, the
man murdered was of another tribe, or a Japanese, this Draconian
kind of justice is not administered. Quarrels among
tribesmen are settled by private retribution, and no one interferes
either one way or the other. These quarrels, however,
very seldom occur, as the Ainu are naturally a peaceful people.
Imprisonment does not exist, for the simple reason that the
Ainu have no prisons. They do not know what a prison is;
neither is capital punishment practised by them. According
to their own ideas they are not cruel to children, for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
seldom see them wilfully ill-treating them; but according to
civilised notions Ainu women make shockingly bad mothers.
They love, but they do not look after, nor practically take
care of, their little ones after these are about a year and a
half old; and as to washing them, combing their hair, educating
them, or trying to cure them of the thousand and one
wretched skin diseases, which come chiefly by their own
neglect, an Ainu mother puts her hand to these things
no more than the men put theirs to the building of a temple
or the creation of a literature. This neglect is not with
them, as it would be with us, an intolerable crime, but is
the natural result of their animal instinct as contradistinguished
from rational development. For if a baby is not old enough
at one and a half years of age to take care of himself, he is of
no good as an Ainu. It is needless to add that, in these circumstances,
most of them are of no good, and that the percentage
of infantile deaths is appalling to a civilised mind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="small">Marital Relations, and Causes that Limit Population.</span></h2>

<p>The laws of marriage in the Ainu country are not very
stringent; in fact, there are no laws. If a young man takes
a fancy to a pretty hairy maid, and the maid reciprocates his
affections, all they have to do is to go and live together, and
there is no Mrs. Grundy to be scandalised at the want of
closer forms and ceremonies. There is no function to celebrate
the occasion; there are no wedding presents, no bridesmaids,
no officiating clergyman, and no old slipper flung after the
happy pair as soon as the knot is tied. The bridegroom
either goes to live in his bride's hut, or, if he does not care for
his mother-in-law, he will bring his lady-love to his own father's
hut. Usually, however, the two, especially if their respective
families are large, prefer to build a hut of their own. The
honeymoon is spent in house-building, and while the bride
carries the loads of timber and long reeds, the bridegroom
accomplishes the more difficult task of putting them together
as well as he can for future shelter. All goes well with the
happy couple until the roof has to be lifted up bodily and
perched on the forked poles, during which process "family
rows" generally begin. But they do not last long, and when
the house is finished, though not decorated, home peace reigns
within, and the bridegroom, as we have already seen, proceeds
to ornament his chief treasure&mdash;his wife&mdash;with tattoos on her
arms. This idyllic state of things is not specially permanent,
for soon after this first marriage the Ainu feels that he would
like another wife, and, without thinking twice about it, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
marries again. Though savage and barbarian, the Ainu is
shrewd enough not to take his second wife to live with his
first, for he knows what the result would be, human nature
being the same in Yezo as it is in London, and jealousy as
strong among the tattooed women of the hairy people as
among the fair-skinned daughters of the West. All women
are bad enough when out of temper, but the Ainu women are
pre-eminent in this respect. Our shock-haired bigamist calls
his first wife <i>poro-machi</i>&mdash;"great wife," and he calls the other
<i>pon-machi</i>&mdash;"small wife;" and as long as the two females
do not live under the same roof they are all happy with
the arrangement. If, indeed, he chooses to have more than
these two wives he thinks small blame to himself. There
is no bar of any kind in his code to his having a third "half;"
but this seldom happens now, for the women are not in such
over abundance in the Ainu country as to allow each man to
indulge in a "triple alliance." The Ainu are therefore polygamists
when they can find the third woman, and almost
always bigamists when this is possible. The wife does not
take her husband's name, for no Ainu has a family surname;
and each man or woman is called after some peculiarity which
he or she possesses, or after some event or accident which has
befallen them. For instance, <i>Una-charo</i>, a man's name, means
"Sprinkled-ashes," and <i>Yei-Ainu</i>, "Dangerous Ainu," &amp;c.;
and <i>Korunke</i>, a woman's name, means "Ice-eater;" <i>Reoback</i>,
"Who burst three times," and so on, each person having a
different name, which is nothing more than a nick-name.
When the girl gets married she does not drop this nick-name,
neither, as has been said, does she take her husband's name,
though sometimes she is called So-and-So's wife. Supposing
that Miss Burst-three-times were to marry Mr. Sprinkled-ashes,
she would be Mr. Sprinkled-ashes' wife, and would still
be called by her maiden name, Burst-three-times.</p>

<p>It is impossible to quote exact statistics of the Ainu population,
and whether the women outnumber the men, but from
my own observation I should think that females are in excess
of the males in some districts, and about even in others.</p>

<p>The man, naturally, is the lord and master of the household,
and the wife is like a kind of inferior being or a slave, whose
duty it is to obey her male companion. She has to yield in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
everything, whether she is right or wrong; she is occasionally
beaten; she never takes active part in any of her husband's
Bacchanalian revels; but though she leads a sad kind of life,
a life of hard work and no pleasure, she does not seem to be
any the worse for it. There are wives, of course, who, as in
other countries, give a "pretty rough time" to their husbands;
but in the Ainu country these are certainly the exception.
As there is no ceremony of marriage, there is naturally no
"divorce;" but if an Ainu gets sick of his wife, all he has
to do is to leave her and go elsewhere, or else to banish her
from his hut. This, however, very seldom happens, for that
rare creature the henpecked Ainu husband is willing to put
up with a lot; and though brave enough to encounter single-handed
a bear, the hairy man is by no means valiant enough
to face his wife's temper; while, for all that she is practically
a slave, and personally an inferior, is sometimes in Ainuland,
as everywhere else, the strongest factor in the domestic sum.</p>

<p>As long as the wife does her duty well as a "beast of burden,"
little more is required from her. Her morals, as far as I could
make out, are not well looked after. Adultery is not considered
a crime. I do not mean by this that adultery is practised
on principle, for it is not so: there is no reason whatever
why it should be, for each man has his own wife or wives; but
if adultery were practised by any members of a community,
what we consider a dreadful crime would be regarded as a
mere "joke" among the hairy people. The husband, like any
other animal, dumb or not, would naturally resent the intrusion,
but the community would in no way interfere, or punish the
offender. A girl is considered fit to be married when she is
about sixteen years of age; a man about twenty, or as soon
as the body is fully developed.</p>

<p>People as a rule marry in the same village. It is but
seldom that a girl marries a man or a man a girl of a
different village. Villages, as we have seen, are generally
composed of only a few houses, and the result of this strict
endogamy is, that marriages take place among very near
relations. In very small villages of only one or two houses,
the father has been known to marry his own daughter, the
uncle his own niece, &amp;c. But enough of this. The result of
this dreadful state of affairs is, that the race is rapidly dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
out, destroyed by consumption, lunacy, and poverty of blood.
All the members of one village are necessarily related to one
another; and, as I have demonstrated in a previous chapter,
this is the main cause why certain diseases are common to one
community and utterly unknown to others, and certain hereditary
talents or tendencies are frequent in one village and
imperceptible in the next.</p>

<p>The Ainu seem to have no Platonic love; their love is
purely sexual. It is not to be wondered at, in a country where
marital relations are so peculiar, that very little love is felt for
children beyond a certain age. The mother suckles her own
child usually for seven or eight months. She can bear children
till she is about thirty-five, though some who seem to be much
older are still fruitful. It was difficult to ascertain this fact
for no Ainu knows his own age. As far as I could learn
fertility is neither hindered nor checked in any way&mdash;either by
adopting a peculiar diet or by other practices. On the other
hand, many a woman is sterile, and many are also affected
with the most horrible of all diseases. I am inclined to think,
however, that this special malady was imported to Yezo with
Japanese civilisation, for it is in the more civilised parts of the
Ainu country that it is most frequent.</p>

<p>There is probably no country in the world where there is so
much loss of infant life due to want, accidents, and diseases,
as with the Ainu. Abortion is common, owing to the severe
exertion of the mother during pregnancy; and many a child
dies not many days after birth for the same reason, and consequent
disappearance of milk in the mother's breasts. The
greater mortality of children, however, is between the age of
six and ten. Only a small percentage of these poor creatures
live to take part in the game of life; while many succumb to
ill-treatment and the most horrible skin eruptions. Thus we
have a good explanation of the frightful rapidity with which
the Ainu race is fast disappearing. Naturally, those few who
survive grow strong and healthy; but their great fondness for
alcoholic drinks, which they can now so easily procure from
the Japanese, destroys even them.</p>

<p>One is generally struck in Ainuland by the number of old
men and children, and by the almost entire lack of young
fellows between the age of fifteen and thirty. This is due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
mainly to the great increase of mortality in children during
the last two generations. The sadness which seems to oppress
the Ainu, and which we see depicted on the face of each
individual, is nothing but the outcome of this degeneration of
the race. As a race the Ainu will soon be extinct. I dare
say that in fifty years from now&mdash;probably not so long&mdash;not
one of the hairy savages, who were once the masters of Sakhalin,
Yezo, the Kuriles, Kamschatka, and the whole of the
southern Japanese Empire, will be left. Not one of these
strange people&mdash;soft, good, and gentle, but savage, brave, and
disreputable&mdash;will live to see their country civilised; and in the
life which they have led of filth and vice they will die in front
of that greater scourge, civilisation, leaving behind no traces
of themselves, of their past, of their history, nor of their
present&mdash;nothing but a faint recollection, a tradition, that in
Yezo and the Kuriles died the last remains of those curious
people, the Hairy Ainu.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
